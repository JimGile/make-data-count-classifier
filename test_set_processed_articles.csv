Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the input JSON and extract the dataset IDs. The user provided a JSON object with sections like title, authors, abstract, data_availability, and other_dataset_citations. 

Starting with Task 1: Identify valid dataset IDs. The data_availability section is empty, so I'll check the other_dataset_citations. There are three entries here. Let me look at each one.

First citation: {""dataset_ids"": [""10.17882/49388""], ""citation_context"": ...}. The DOI here looks valid. The citation context mentions ""A global database of vertical profiles derived from Biogeochemical Argo float measurements for biogeochemical and bio-optical applications|SEANOE|10.17882/49388"". The prefix is ""10."" which matches the required format. Since the citation context clearly indicates it's a dataset, this is a valid DOI. 

Second entry: {""dataset_ids"": [""10.17882/47142""], ""citation_context"": ...}. Similarly, the DOI here is valid. The context mentions a global bio-optical database, so that's another valid dataset.

Third entry: {""dataset_ids"": [""10.5194/essd-2017-58""], ""citation_context"": ...}. This is a DOI. The context says two databases derived from BGC-Argo float measurements. Since the DOI starts with ""10."" and follows the pattern, it's valid. 

Now, I need to check if these IDs are actually datasets. The data_availability section is empty, so these are the only valid ones. There are no other citations or data mentions. 

Next, Task 2: Classify the types. The abstract mentions ""Biogeochemical-Argo database"" which points to the data_availability section. Since the data_availability is empty, but the citations refer to databases, I need to use the citation contexts. 

For the first citation, the context mentions ""global database of vertical profiles derived from Biogeochemical Argo float measurements"". This is a primary dataset because it's directly related to the study's focus. Similarly, the second citation mentions a bio-optical database, which is also a primary dataset. The third citation refers to two databases, which could be primary or secondary. However, since the abstract mentions ""global Biogeochemical-Argo database"" and the data_availability is empty, it's likely that these are primary datasets. 

Wait, but the data_availability is empty, but the citations are there. So, the data_availability section is empty, so the only valid datasets are the ones in the other_dataset_citations. 

Therefore, all three dataset IDs are valid. Now, Task 3: Format the results. Since there are three valid dataset IDs, each with their types. The types are Primary for all. 

I need to ensure that the output is in the correct JSON format. Each dataset is an object with dataset_id and type. The missing JSON structure is for when no dataset is found, but here all are present. 

So, the final JSON array would have three entries, each with the dataset IDs and their types.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON string with a paper section and wants me to extract dataset IDs and classify them. Let me start by understanding the input.

First, the paper title is ""Effective and Reversible Carbon Dioxide Insertion into Cerium Pyrazolates"". The authors are listed, but the abstract mentions CO2 insertion into pyrazolate complexes. The data_availability is empty, and other_dataset_citations is an empty array.

The task is to extract valid dataset IDs. The key here is to look in the data_availability section. Since it's empty, maybe there's no dataset available. The other_dataset_citations is also empty, so no citations. 

But wait, the abstract mentions CO2 insertion. Are there any dataset IDs related to this? The abstract talks about the reaction, but not specific dataset IDs. The data_availability section is empty, so no dataset available. 

So, according to Task 1, since there are no valid dataset IDs found in both sections, we need to return the ""Missing"" scenario. The JSON structure should have a dataset_id as ""Missing"" and type as ""Missing"". 

I need to make sure I'm not extracting any other IDs. The data_availability and other_dataset_citations are empty. The abstract doesn't mention any dataset IDs. Therefore, the correct response is to return the missing dataset.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON string with a paper section and wants me to extract dataset IDs and classify them. Let me start by reading through the input.

First, the title is about metal-ligand cooperativity in calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate. The authors are named, and the abstract mentions catalysis, transition metals, and the formation of C-C bonds. The data_availability section is empty, and other_dataset_citations is also empty. 

Looking at the data_availability section, there's no information provided. So I need to check if any dataset IDs are mentioned. The other_dataset_citations list is empty. According to the task, I should only extract dataset IDs from data_availability and other_dataset_citations. Since both are empty, there are no valid dataset IDs to extract.

Now, for classification. The task says to use the abstract and citation context. The abstract mentions catalysts, transition metals, and the formation of bonds. The keywords here might be related to catalysis, which could be primary or secondary. But since there's no explicit mention of a dataset, and both sections are empty, there's no way to determine the type. 

The fallback rule says if ambiguous, default to Primary. But since there's no dataset mentioned, maybe the answer is that there are no dataset IDs found, so the output is the ""Missing"" scenario. 

I need to make sure I'm not extracting any other data. The user specified not to extract other academic papers or the paper itself. Since both sections are empty, the result is no dataset IDs found. Therefore, the JSON array should have a single object with ""dataset_id"" as ""Missing"" and ""type"" as ""Missing"".

It is shown that O 2  immediately dissociates upon first contact with the Mg anode (modeled as Mg(0001), Mg(10 1 \u203e \n0)A, and Mg(10 1 \u203e \n1)), heating the surface to several 1000\u2005K. The high temperature assists the further oxidation and forms a rock salt interphase intersected by several grain boundaries. Among the Mg surface terminations, Mg(10 1 \u203e \n0)A is the most reactive, forming an MgO layer with a thickness of up to 25\u2005\u00c5. The trained force field can be used to model the ongoing reactions in Mg\u2013air batteries but also to study the oxidation of magnesium metal in general."",""data_availability"":""Data Availability Statement The data that support the findings of this study are openly available in zenodo at  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7074790 .

Okay, let's start by looking at the input data. The user provided a JSON string with sections for a paper. My task is to extract and classify dataset IDs.

First, I need to check the `data_availability` section. The data availability states that the data is available in Zenodo with a DOI. The DOI is ""10.5281/zenodo.7074790"". Wait, but the important rule says if it's a citation for a publication, we shouldn't extract it. However, the DOI here seems to be for a dataset, so maybe it's valid. Then there's a GitHub repository with a KVIK optimization routine, which doesn't look like a dataset. 

Next, the `other_dataset_citations` list is empty. So, only the Zenodo DOI is a potential dataset ID. Now, I need to check if this DOI matches the criteria for a dataset. The DOI starts with ""10."" and has a suffix. The suffix here is ""7074790"", which is valid. The citation context in the data availability mentions the data is available in Zenodo, which is a data repository. So this seems to be a valid dataset ID.

Now, the classification. The abstract mentions the formation of a passivating boundary layer at the Mg anode. The dataset here is related to the Mg anode's passivation. The DOI is for a dataset, so it's a Primary dataset because it's generated by the authors as part of their research. The other part of the citation context is about data availability, which supports the classification.

So, the dataset_id is ""10.5281/zenodo.7074790"", and the type is Primary. Since there are no other valid dataset IDs, I proceed to format the output accordingly.

In decapods (crabs, lobsters, crayfish, and prawns), rates of polyandry are likely to be variable, but the extent to which patterns of multiple paternity reflect multiple mating, and thus are shaped by postmating processes that bias fertilization toward one or a subset of mated males, is unclear. Here, we use microsatellite markers to examine the frequency of multiple mating (the presence of spermatophores from two or more males) and patterns of paternity in wild populations of western rock lobster ( Panulirus cygnus ). Our data confirm that >45% of females had attached spermatophores arising from at least two males (i.e., confirming polyandry), but we found very limited evidence for multiple paternity; among 24 clutches sampled in this study, only two arose from fertilizations by two or more males. Single inferred paternal genotypes accounted for all remaining progeny genotypes in each clutch, including several instances when the mother had been shown to mate with two or more males.

However, factors affecting probe design and methods for optimizing probe sets to focal taxa remain underexplored. Here, we use newly available beetle (Coleoptera) genomic resources to investigate factors affecting UCE probe set design using  phyluce . In particular, we explore the effects of stringency during initial design steps, as well as base genome choice on resulting probe sets and locus recovery. We found that both base genome choice and initial bait design stringency parameters greatly alter the number of resultant probes included in final probe sets and strongly affect the number of loci detected and recovered during in silico testing of these probe sets. In addition, we identify attributes of base genomes that correlated with high performance in probe design.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON string representing a paper section and wants me to extract and classify dataset IDs. Let's start by understanding the input.

First, looking at the `data_availability` section. The text mentions DNA sequences: GenBank MK838494 to MK838511, phyluce BED/BAM files, and a Dryad DOI. Also, there are custom scripts available. The other_dataset_citations is empty here. 

So, the data_availability includes both a DNA sequence dataset and a BED/BAM file. The user's task is to extract valid dataset IDs. For DOIs, there's a DOI in the data_availability, but the citation context is not provided. However, the key point here is that the DOI might be a dataset_id. But wait, the important rule says if a DOI is presented as a citation, it's not a dataset_id. But here, the data_availability has a DOI. Wait, the input data says ""DATA AVAILABILITY DNA sequences: GenBank MK838494 to MK838511; phyluce  BED/BAM files..."" So the DOI is not in the data_availability section. Wait, the user's input data might have a typo here. Let me check again.

Looking back, the data_availability section says ""DNA sequences: GenBank MK838494 to MK838511; phyluce  BED/BAM files for probe design experiments and Adephaga_2.9Kv1 final probe set fasta file: Dryad  https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2f62927 ; Custom scripts: Alexander 2018a: Comparing_monolithic_UCE_fastas available from;  https://github.com/laninsky/comparing_monolithic_UCE_fastas ; Alexander 2018b: Phase_target available from  https://github.com/laninsky/reference_aligning_to_established_loci/tree/master/phase_target ; Alexander 2018c: distance_calcs available from:  https://github.com/laninsky/distance_calcs ; Alexander 2018d: Phase_everyone available from  https://github.com/laninsky/reference_aligning_to_established_loci/tree/master/phase_everyone .""

So here, the DOI is in the Dryad link. The other dataset citations are empty. The data_availability includes a dataset with a DOI. But according to the important rule, a DOI is a dataset_id only if it's used as a citation. However, in this case, the DOI is part of the Dryad link, not a citation. So maybe the DOI is not a dataset_id here. Wait, the data_availability section says ""dataset"" in the context of DNA sequences, which are datasets. So perhaps the DOI is not part of the data_availability but part of the Dryad link. Wait, but the user's input data might have a typo here. Let me check again.

The data_availability says ""phyluce  BED/BAM files for probe design experiments and Adephaga_2.9Kv1 final probe set fasta file: Dryad  https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2f62927 ; Custom scripts..."" So the Dryad DOI is part of the data_availability. The other dataset citations are empty. Therefore, in this case, the dataset_id would be the Dryad DOI. But according to the important rule, if a DOI is presented as a citation, it's not a dataset_id. However, in this case, the Dryad DOI is part of the data_availability, not a citation. Therefore, it's a valid dataset_id. So the dataset_id here is 10.5061/dryad.2f62927.

Wait, but the other dataset citations are empty. So the only valid dataset_id here is the Dryad DOI. But the user's input data might have a typo where the DOI is actually a dataset_id. Alternatively, maybe there's another dataset_id. Let me check again.

Looking at the other_dataset_citations array, it's empty. The data_availability includes a Dryad DOI. So that's one dataset_id. But according to the important rule, if a DOI is presented as a citation, it's not a dataset_id. But here, the Dryad DOI is part of the data_availability. So this is a valid dataset_id. So in Task 1, we have to extract this as a dataset_id.

Now, for classification. The abstract mentions that the authors are using phyluce for UCE phylogenomics. The data_availability includes a Dryad DOI. The key words in the abstract are ""probe set design"", ""UEP"", ""phyluce"", which are related to the UCE design. The data_availability also includes a BED/BAM file for probe design experiments. So this seems like a dataset related to the research. Therefore, this would be a Primary dataset because it's used in the research. 

But let's check the other_dataset_citations. They are empty. So only the Dryad DOI is considered here. Therefore, the dataset_id is 10.5061/dryad.2f62927, and the type is Primary. 

But wait, the data_availability also includes a custom script. The script is part of the data_availability, so that's another dataset. However, the user's input data shows that the other_dataset_citations is empty. The data_availability includes the Dryad DOI and the custom scripts. But according to the task, we only need to extract dataset_ids. So the dataset_id here is the Dryad DOI. 

Therefore, in Task 1, we have one valid dataset_id. Then, in Task 2, we classify it as Primary. 

So the final answer would be a JSON array with that dataset_id and type.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON string representing a paper section, and I need to extract and classify dataset IDs. Let's start by understanding the structure.

First, I need to identify valid dataset IDs. The data_availability section has several DOIs listed. The important rule is to check if these DOIs are truly data-related. The user mentioned that DOIs should be extracted only if they refer to a dataset, not a publication. So I need to look at the citation contexts here.

Looking at the data_availability, the first DOI is ""10.5441/001/1.v1cs4nn0"". The citation context says ""Fiedler, Leppelsack, Leppelsack, Stahl, Wieding, O. & Wikelski, M. (2019). Data from: LifeTrack White Stork Bavaria."" This seems to indicate that this is a dataset related to the study, so it's a valid dataset ID. The other DOIs in the list also have similar citation contexts. 

Next, I need to check if there are any Accession IDs. The data_availability section mentions ""DATA ACCESSIBILITY The data used for this study are available through..."", but there's no explicit mention of an Accession ID. The other_dataset_citations have dataset IDs like ""10.5441/001/1.ck04mn78"", which are Accession IDs. So those are valid.

Now, I need to classify each dataset. The abstract mentions that the study uses lifetime GPS data from 169 white storks. The keywords related to primary and secondary datasets are important here. The study's findings are about how migration distance affects survival, so the dataset likely relates to the research. Since the dataset is directly related, it's a Primary dataset.

I should check if there are any Secondary datasets mentioned. The abstract doesn't explicitly state that, but the data availability includes the DOI, which is more likely a Primary dataset. The other citations also have dataset IDs that are Accession IDs, which are Primary. 

So, all the valid dataset IDs are extracted. The classification for each should be Primary since they are directly related to the research. Finally, format the results as per the required JSON structure.

Ichthyoplankton surveys have turned to molecular methods (DNA barcoding & metabarcoding) for identification of eggs and larval fish due to challenges of morphological identification. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of using metabarcoding methods on mock communities of known fish egg DNA. We constructed six mock communities with known ratios of species. In addition, we analyzed two samples from a large field collection of fish eggs and compared metabarcoding results with traditional DNA barcoding results. We examine the ability of our metabarcoding methods to detect species and relative proportion of species identified in each mock community. We found that our metabarcoding methods were able to detect species at very low input proportions; however, levels of successful detection depended on the markers used in amplification, suggesting that the use of multiple markers is desirable. Variability in our quantitative results may result from amplification bias as well as interspecific variation in mitochondrial DNA copy number.

The abstract mentions using metabarcoding methods in a study, and they have data availability from Dryad. 

First, I need to check the data_availability section. The DOI is provided as 10.5061/dryad.zw3r22854. According to the guidelines, this is a valid dataset_id. The citation context here is the Dryad link, which clearly refers to a dataset. So that's one dataset.

Next, the other_dataset_citations section is empty. So no additional citations. Now, I need to classify this dataset. The abstract mentions that metabarcoding is used in this study, and the data is available.

Okay, let's start by looking at the input text. The title mentions a study on polyploidy and its effect on climate tolerance in Solidago canadensis. The authors are Wan Jizhong, Oduor Ayub M. O., Pouteau Robin, Wang Beilei, Chen Luxi, Yang Beifen, Yu Feihai, and Li Junmin.

The abstract states that polyploidy affects plant traits and adaptability. They tested whether invasive populations have higher ploidy, greater height, stem base diameter, and wider climate range than native ones. They used DNA sequences from NCBI and Dryad. The data_availability mentions depositing sequences in NCBI and Dryad, so that's a primary dataset.

Looking at other_dataset_citations, there are no entries provided. The data_availability section clearly states the dataset IDs from NCBI and Dryad. Since there are no citations, maybe those are the only datasets. But wait, the abstract mentions ""DNA sequences have been deposited"" in NCBI and Dryad. The DOI or accession ID would be the dataset_id. But the input data here doesn't include any specific dataset IDs. However, the data_availability mentions depositing sequences, which might be part of a dataset. But according to the key definitions, the dataset_id is a unique identifier. Since there's no explicit DOI or accession ID in the input, maybe there are no valid dataset_ids. But the abstract mentions that the data is deposited in NCBI and Dryad, which might be considered as dataset_ids. However, the task says to extract only valid dataset_ids. Since the input doesn't include any specific IDs, perhaps the answer is that there are no valid dataset_ids. But the data_availability mentions depositing sequences, which could be a dataset_id. However, the input JSON structure doesn't include those IDs. Wait, looking back at the input structure, the other_dataset_citations are empty. The data_availability is a string with ""DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT DNA sequences..."", which might be part of the dataset. But according to the instructions, the dataset_ids should be extracted from the data_availability or other_dataset_citations. Since there are no entries in other_dataset_citations, maybe the answer is no dataset_ids found. However, the abstract mentions that the data is deposited in NCBI and Dryad, which could be considered as dataset_ids. But the input JSON structure doesn't have those entries. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that there are no valid dataset_ids. But maybe the user expects that the NCBI and Dryad IDs are included. But according to the input structure, those are in the data_availability section. Wait, the input data is structured as a JSON with ""data_availability"" as a string. The other_dataset_citations are empty. So the dataset_ids are from the data_availability. But the input doesn't have any specific dataset IDs. Therefore, there are no valid dataset_ids. Hence, the output would be a missing dataset JSON. But let me check again. The data_availability says DNA sequences have been deposited in NCBI and Dryad, but the input doesn't specify the actual dataset_ids. However, according to the key definitions, dataset_ids are either DOIs or accession IDs. Since the input doesn't have DOIs or accession IDs, maybe there are no valid dataset_ids. Therefore, the correct output is to return a missing dataset JSON.

Remarkable shape diversity has been observed within locomotor groups indicating many\u2010to\u2010one mapping of form onto function. Significant shape differences have mainly been related to the overall pectoral girdle geometry and the shape of the coracoid. Most prominent shape differences have been found between burrowing and nonburrowing species with headfirst and backward burrowing species significantly differing from one another and from the other locomotor groups. The pectoral girdle shapes of burrowing species have generally larger moment arms for (simulated) humerus retractor muscles across the shoulder joint, which might be an adaptation to the burrowing behavior.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract and classify dataset IDs from the given paper. First, I need to parse the input JSON structure. The paper's title is ""Ecomorphology of the pectoral girdle in anurans..."" and the authors are listed. The abstract mentions data availability with a DOI and a citation context. The other_dataset_citations section has a dataset ID.

Starting with Task 1: Identify valid dataset IDs. The data_availability mentions a DOI in Appendix S1, Table A1. The DOI is valid because it's explicitly stated as a dataset ID. The citation context includes the DOI, so that's a valid entry. Then, the other_dataset_citations has another dataset ID with a citation context. Both entries meet the criteria.

Now, Task 2: Classify the types. The abstract mentions shape diversity in pectoral girdles and their impact on muscle moment arms. The DOI and other dataset citation are related to the research. Since the abstract clearly discusses shape differences and the data is used in the study, I should classify them as Primary. The other dataset citation's context is about a study using similar methods, which aligns with the research.

Task 3: Format the results. Since both dataset IDs are valid, the output should include both entries. The JSON structure needs to reflect that each dataset is classified as Primary. I need to make sure to check the keywords in the abstract and citation context to confirm the classification. The fallback rule is applied here because the abstract clearly states the research focus.

In this 6-year study in an old-field ecosystem, we manipulated insect abundance (reduced and control), the propagule pressure of an invasive nitrogen-fixing plant (propagules added and control), and soil nutrient availability (nitrogen added, nitrogen reduced and control) in a fully crossed, completely randomized plot design. We found that nutrient amendment and, occasionally, insect abundance interacted with the propagule pressure of an invasive plant to alter above-and belowground structure and function at our site. Not surprisingly, nutrient amendment had a direct effect on aboveground biomass and soil nutrient mineralization. The introduction of invasive nitrogen-fixing plant propagules interacted with nutrient amendment and insect presence to alter soil bacterial abundance and the activity of the microbial community. While the larger-scale, longer-term bulk measurements such as biomass production and nutrient mineralization responded to the direct effects of our treatments, the shorter-term and dynamic microbial communities tended to respond to interactions among our treatments.

The proliferation of camera trapping has enabled the collection of large datasets on wildlife, but researchers face hurdles inferring interactions from observational data. Recent advances in hierarchical co\u2010abundance models infer species interactions while accounting for two species' detection probabilities, shared responses to environmental covariates, and propagate uncertainty throughout the entire modeling process. However, current approaches remain unsuitable for interacting species whose natural densities differ by an order of magnitude and have contrasting detection probabilities, such as predator\u2013prey interactions, which introduce zero inflation and overdispersion in count histories. Here, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical N\u2010mixture co\u2010abundance model that is suitable for inferring predator\u2013prey interactions. We accounted for excessive zeros in count histories using an informed zero\u2010inflated Poisson distribution in the abundance formula and accounted for overdispersion in count histories by including a random effect per sampling unit and sampling occasion in the detection probability formula. We demonstrate that models with these modifications outperform alternative approaches, improve model goodness\u2010of\u2010fit, and overcome parameter convergence failures. We highlight its utility using 20 camera trapping datasets from 10 tropical forest landscapes in Southeast Asia and estimate four predator\u2013prey relationships between tigers, clouded leopards, and muntjac and sambar deer. Tigers had a negative effect on muntjac abundance, providing support for top\u2010down regulation, while clouded leopards had a positive effect on muntjac and sambar deer, likely driven by shared responses to unmodelled covariates like hunting.

Okay, let's start by looking at the input data. The user provided a JSON string with sections for the paper. My task is to extract valid dataset IDs and classify them as Primary or Secondary.

First, I need to check the `data_availability` section. The abstract mentions ""DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT"" and provides a DOI: 10.5061/dryad.b8gtht7h3. That looks like a DOI. But wait, the IMPORTANT DOI VALIDATION RULE says I shouldn't extract DOIs from publications. However, the citation context here is about the dataset's availability, so maybe it's valid. Let me check the citation context again. The abstract says ""R code and data..."" which are part of the dataset. So the DOI might be a valid dataset ID here.

Next, the `other_dataset_citations` section is empty. So only the DOI is considered. Now, I need to validate this DOI. Since it's provided in the data_availability, and the citation context is about the dataset's availability, it's likely a dataset ID. So the dataset_id would be 10.5061/dryad.b8gtht7h3.

Now, checking the classification. The abstract mentions using Bayesian models, which are part of the study's approach. The keywords related to Primary are ""generated in this study"" or ""newly sequenced"". The model they developed is specifically for predator-prey interactions, which is a novel study. So the dataset is directly related to the research, making it Primary.

So the final answer would have this dataset_id and type as Primary.

These interactions between stressors, whether additive or antagonistic, may have profound effects on our assumptions about and predictions for any given system. Here we address this gap by exploring the interactive effects of introduced predators and elevated temperatures on emerging aquatic insects across alpine lakes. Using a crossed factorial field survey, we examine whether warmer temperatures either directly affect the magnitude or diversity of insect emergence, or mediate the impacts of predation via interactions with predator presence. Based on data from more than 11,000 insects collected across a two-year period, we find a 71% reduction in insect emergence associated with an additional 3.6 C of water temperature in oligotrophic alpine lakes. While our work confirms prior findings that predator presence drives strong reductions in insect emergence, we find that the effects of predation are significantly weaker in warmer lakes (2% reduction in warmest lakes studied vs. 75% reduction in coldest). Combining our results with regional studies of predator communities to identify mechanisms suggests that the interaction effects between temperature and predator presence are likely due to changes in predator behavior across temperatures.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided a JSON string with a paper section and wants me to extract and classify dataset IDs. Let me start by understanding the structure of the input.

First, the title is empty, which probably means the paper isn't about datasets. The authors list is ""Ann Christin Reiers"" with an [a] note, so maybe she's the author. The abstract mentions studies on gold(III) coordination and testing of catalytic activity. The data availability is empty, so I'll check the other_dataset_citations section.

Looking at the other_dataset_citations, there's a dataset with dataset_ids [""10.1002/ejoc.202000139""] and a citation context. The citation context includes a DOI. Now, I need to check if this DOI is a dataset ID. The important rule says only extract DOIs if they're explicitly used as dataset IDs. The DOI here seems to be a valid dataset ID. The citation context mentions ""Downloaded from"" and ""Caltech Digital Library,"" which suggests it's a dataset. So that's a valid dataset ID.

Wait, but the data availability section is empty. The other dataset citation is the only one. So I should process that. Now, check if this dataset is related to the paper's research. The abstract talks about gold(III) coordination and catalytic activity, which are part of the study. The dataset might be related. Now, according to the classification rules, if the dataset is directly related to the novel research, it's Primary. The keywords in the abstract might help. Since the dataset is related, I'll classify it as Primary.

So the dataset_id is 10.1002/ejoc.202000139, and the type is Primary. The other citation is a DOI, which we've already considered. The user wants only valid dataset IDs, so this one is valid. The other dataset citation is a DOI, which we also process. So the final JSON array should include this dataset.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the provided JSON input and extract the dataset IDs. The user wants only valid dataset IDs, so I have to check both the data_availability and other_dataset_citations sections.

Looking at the abstract, there's a mention of a dataset in the data_availability section. The data_availability key has a value that includes a DOI. The important rule says if a DOI is used as a dataset_id, it must be validated. In this case, the DOI is provided, so it's valid. Also, the citation_context for that DOI is empty, which is allowed.

Next, I check the other_dataset_citations. There are two entries. The first one has a dataset_id with a DOI. Again, the citation context is empty, so it's valid. The second dataset_id is an Accession ID, which fits the definition. The citation context for that is ""84."", which seems to be a placeholder. 

Now, I need to ensure there are no extraneous entries. The other entries have citation contexts that might be placeholders or other references, but those are not dataset IDs. So, only the first two entries are valid. 

Now, for classification. The abstract mentions the Ichilo River's data, so it's related to the study. The dataset IDs are from the U.S. Geological Survey, which is the authors' institution. The data_availability section mentions data release, which aligns with primary data. The other dataset citations are from previous studies, which are secondary. 

Applying the primary/secondary classification rules: the first dataset is primary because it's the U.S. Geological Survey data, and the second is secondary since it's a citation from another study. 

Finally, format the results. Since both dataset IDs are valid, return them in an array. If there were no dataset IDs, return the missing structure. In this case, both are present, so the output is the array with both dataset entries.

No paleo\u2010scarps or potentially analogous topographic features are evident in pre\u2010earthquake Worldview\u20101 and Worldview\u20102 satellite data. Two excavations across the surface rupture expose near\u2010surface fault geometry and mixed aeolian\u2010sheetwash sediment faulted only in the 2016 earthquake. A 10.6 \u00b1 0.4 ka optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age of sheetwash sediment provides a minimum estimate for the period of quiescence prior to 2016 rupture. Seven cosmogenic beryllium\u201010 ( 10 Be) bedrock erosion rates are derived for samples < 5 km distance from the surface rupture on the hanging\u2010wall and foot\u2010wall, and three from samples 19 to 50\u2009km from the surface rupture. No distinction is found between fault proximal rates (1.3 \u00b1 0.1 to 2.6 \u00b1 0.2 m Myr \u22121 ) and distal samples (1.4 \u00b1 0.1 to 2.3 \u00b1 0.2 m Myr \u22121 ). The thickness of rock fragments (2\u20135 cm) coseismically displaced in the Petermann earthquake perturbs the steady\u2010state bedrock erosion rate by only 1 to 3%, less than the erosion rate uncertainty estimated for each sample (7\u201312%). Using  10 Be erosion rates and scarp height measurements we estimate approximately 0.5 to 1 Myr of differential erosion is required to return to pre\u2010earthquake topography. By inference any pre\u20102016 fault\u2010related topography likely required a similar time for removal. We conclude that the Petermann earthquake was the first on this fault in the last ca. 0.5\u20131 Myr. Extrapolating single nuclide erosion rates across this timescale introduces large uncertainties, and we cannot resolve whether 2016 represents the first ever surface rupture on this fault, or a\u2009> 1 Myr interseismic period. Either option reinforces the importance of including distributed earthquake sources in fault displacement and seismic hazard analyses."",""data_availability"":"""",""other_dataset_citations"":[""{\""dataset_ids\"": ['10.1080/08120090802546977'], citation_context: \""Constraints on the current rate of deformation and surface uplift of the Australian continent from a new seismic database and low\u2010T thermochronological data|Australian Journal of Earth Sciences|https://doi.org/10.1080/08120090802546977\""}"",""{\""dataset_ids\"": ['10.1177/0959683613515732'], citation_context: \""Late\u2010Holocene climatic variability indicated by three natural archives in arid southern Australia|Holocene|https://doi.org/10.1177/0959683613515732\""}""]}

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to extract dataset IDs from the provided paper and classify them as Primary or Secondary. Let me start by reading through the input JSON to understand the sections.

First, the title is empty, so maybe that's just the paper's title. The authors are also empty, which might mean no authors listed. The abstract mentions a 2016 earthquake and some geological data. The data availability section has two citations. The other dataset citations also have dataset IDs.

Looking at the abstract, there's a mention of ""sheetwash sediment"" and ""cosmogenic beryllium-10 erosion rates."" That sounds like data related to the earthquake. The data availability has two DOI entries. The first one is ""10.1080/08120090802546977."" I need to check if this is a dataset ID. The DOI format is [prefix]/[suffix], and the prefix is always 10. So the first part is 10. followed by 80... So the suffix is 080... which matches. The citation context says it's from a new seismic database and low-T thermochronological data. Since the DOI is used as a reference to a publication, not a dataset, I should ignore this. The second DOI is 10.1177/0959683613515732. The format here is 10. followed by 1177... which also fits. The citation context mentions a climatic archive, so again, it's a publication, so not a dataset ID. 

The other_dataset_citations list has two entries. Both have dataset IDs. The first one's citation context mentions a new seismic database and low-T data. The second mentions a climatic archive. Since they're both references to publications, not datasets, I need to check if they are dataset IDs. The dataset IDs provided are the ones in the citations. The user's task is to extract only dataset IDs. So even if the DOI is a reference, we just take the dataset IDs. 

Now, looking at the classification. The abstract mentions ""sheetwash sediment"" and ""cosmogenic beryllium-10 erosion rates,"" which are data related to the earthquake. These should be Primary because they are data generated by the authors for this study. The other dataset citations also have similar data. Since both entries are in the data availability section, they are Primary. 

So, the dataset IDs are the ones in the citations. The first one is 10.1080/... which is a DOI, but according to the rules, if the citation context is a publication, it's not a dataset ID. However, the user's task is to extract only dataset IDs. So even if the DOI is a reference, we need to consider it as a dataset ID. Wait, but the important rule says that only extract DOIs that are explicitly used as dataset IDs. The citation context here is a publication, so it's not a dataset. Therefore, the first DOI should be excluded. The second one is 10.1177/..., which is a DOI, but again, the citation context is a publication. So both are excluded. 

Wait, but the user's task says to extract only dataset IDs. So even if the DOI is a reference, we just take the dataset IDs. But according to the rules, if the citation context is a publication, it's not a dataset. So maybe the other dataset citations are dataset IDs. Let me check again. The other_dataset_citations have the dataset_ids as [""10.1080/...""] and [""10.1177/...""]. Both are DOIs, and the citation contexts mention publications. Therefore, they are not dataset IDs. 

So in this case, there are no valid dataset IDs found. Therefore, the output should be a missing dataset entry. Wait, but the data_availability is empty. The abstract mentions data, but the data_availability section is empty. The other dataset citations have dataset IDs, but the citation contexts are publications. So the answer is that no dataset IDs were found. Therefore, the JSON array would have a missing dataset entry.

Okay, let's tackle this dataset classification problem. First, I need to look through the provided JSON data to find valid dataset IDs and then determine their types.

Starting with the `data_availability` section. The text mentions ""Thoracic cavity segmentations and discrete pleural effusion segmentations we have annotated on 402 CT scans acquired from patients with non-small cell lung cancer."" The DOI here is 10.7937/K9/TCIA.2015.PF0M9REI. I need to check if this is a valid dataset ID. The DOI starts with 10.7937... which matches the format. The citation context says it's from the NSCLC Radiomics dataset, which is a valid source. So that's a primary dataset.

Next, the other dataset citation. The second one has 10.7937/tcia.2020.6c7y-gq39. This looks like an Accession ID. The citation context mentions it's for the thoracic volume and pleural effusion segmentations in diseased lungs. Since the data is publicly available in NIfTI format, this is also a primary dataset.

Now, checking for any other potential IDs. The abstract mentions ""Thoracic cavity segmentations will be valuable..."" and ""pleural effusion segmentations may be valuable..."" which points to these datasets. Both have proper DOI and Citation Context, so they are primary.

Now, classifying each. The first dataset uses the DOI, which fits Primary as it's generated and used for the study. The second dataset is an Accession ID, also Primary. The other_dataset_citations have their own citations, but the main data is already covered.

No missing dataset IDs. So the final output should be an array with both dataset IDs and their types.

Okay, let's tackle this dataset classification problem. First, I need to parse the input JSON and extract the relevant sections. The user provided a JSON string with sections like title, authors, abstract, data_availability, and other_dataset_citations.

Starting with the data_availability section, there's a statement about U.S. Geological Survey data. I should check if that's a dataset. The data_availability mentions ""Silver Chub otolith microchemistry data"" and ""Western Basin intera-gency August trawl survey data"". These look like data sources, so they might be datasets. But I need to verify if they are actual dataset IDs.

Looking at the citation_context for the first dataset: ""associated species."" That doesn't seem to indicate a dataset ID. The DOI is 10.5066/P9GTUMAY. The citation says ""associated species,"" which might be a citation context, not the dataset ID. So, maybe the DOI is valid but the citation context isn't. The other dataset citation has a DOI of 10.5066/F75M63X0, which also looks like a dataset ID. But again, the citation context here is ""Fisheries Society, Bethesda, Maryland."" Not sure if that's relevant.

Now, the other_dataset_citations include two entries. The first one has a citation context mentioning ""associated species,"" which is probably a citation. The second one has a citation context about ""newly hatched invasive Grass Carp found in Maumee River,"" which is a study on the same topic. Both these entries might be dataset citations. 

Next, I need to check if these are actually dataset IDs. The first dataset has a DOI, which is a valid format. The second one has a DOI, which is also valid. Both seem to be dataset IDs. The citation contexts are part of the data availability, but they don't directly indicate the dataset IDs themselves.

Now, applying the classification rules. The abstract mentions the study on Silver Chub and its spawning, which is directly related to the research. The data_availability mentions U.S. Geological Survey data, which are datasets. The other_dataset_citations refer to studies on the same topic, so they are secondary datasets as they are reused from existing data.

Wait, the abstract says that the data was used for investigating potential spawning locations. So the data_availability should be the primary dataset. The other citations are secondary because they are from studies that were used, not generated by the authors. 

So, the valid dataset IDs are the two DOIs found in the other_dataset_citations. The citation contexts don't provide the exact dataset IDs, but the DOIs are valid. The other dataset citations have their own DOIs, which are valid. 

Therefore, the results should list both dataset IDs as Primary and Secondary, based on their relevance to the research. The missing dataset ID would be if none were found, but in this case, both are present. 

I need to make sure not to extract any other information beyond the dataset IDs. Also, check for any other possible dataset IDs in the data_availability section, but the text doesn't mention any other dataset IDs besides the ones in the citations. 

Finally, format the JSON as specified, ensuring that each dataset is correctly classified as Primary or Secondary.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a JSON object with the text content of a paper. My task is to extract valid dataset IDs and classify them as Primary or Secondary. 

First, I need to check the data_availability section. The abstract mentions data from the LHCb experiment, but the data_availability is empty here. Then, there are no other_dataset_citations entries. 

Looking at the data_availability, since it's empty, there are no datasets mentioned. The abstract talks about measurements of meson cross-sections, but no dataset IDs. The other sections are empty. 

So, according to Task 1, there are no valid dataset IDs found. Therefore, I should output a JSON array with the dataset_id as ""Missing"" and type as ""Missing"". 

Wait, the user's instructions say to check the data_availability and other_dataset_citations. In this case, both are empty. So no dataset IDs. Hence, the answer is just the ""Missing"" JSON.
