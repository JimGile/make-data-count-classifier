Text Content: Abstract Characterizing phytoplankton distribution and dynamics in the world’s open oceans requires in situ observations over a broad range of space and time scales.
In addition to temperature/salinity measure-ments, Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) profiling floats are capable of autonomously observing at high-frequency bio-optical properties such as the chlorophyll fluorescence, a proxy of the chlorophyll a concen-tration (Chla), the particulate backscattering coefficient (bbp), a proxy of the stock of particulate organic car-bon, and the light available for photosynthesis.
We analyzed an unprecedented BGC-Argo database of more than 8,500 multivariable profiles collected in various oceanic conditions, from subpolar waters to subtropical gyres.
Our objective is to refine previously established Chla versus bbp relationships and gain insights into the sources of vertical, seasonal, and regional variability in this relationship.
Despite some regional, seasonal and vertical variations, a general covariation occurs at a global scale.
We distinguish two main contrasted situations: (1) concomitant changes in Chla and bbp that correspond to actual variations in phytoplankton biomass, e.g., in subpolar regimes; (2) a decoupling between the two variables attributed to photoacclima-tion or changes in the relative abundance of nonalgal particles, e.g., in subtropical regimes.
The variability in the bbp:Chla ratio in the surface layer appears to be essentially influenced by the type of particles and by photoacclimation processes.
The large BGC-Argo database helps identifying the spatial and temporal scales at which this ratio is predominantly driven by one or the other of these two factors. .

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided an article ID and a text content, along with potential_dataset_ids. My task is to identify citations of datasets, classify their types as Primary or Secondary, and return them in JSON.

First, I need to look through the text content to find any dataset IDs. The text mentions ""Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) profiling floats"" and ""BGC-Argo database of over 8,500 profiles"". The DOI here is https://doi.org/10.17882/49388. That's one dataset.

Next, I check the potential_dataset_ids. The first entry has a DOI, so that's one dataset. The second entry is an Accession ID, which might be a different dataset. The third and fourth entries are also DOIs, but the context mentions ""Organelli et al."" and ""Barbieux et al."" which are in the same paper. The fifth entry is another DOI, but the context says it's for a different paper. 

Wait, the text says ""data referring to Organelli et al. (2016a; https://doi.org/10.17882/47142) and Barbieux et al. (2017; https://doi.org/10.17882/49388) are freely available on SEANOE."" So these two are from the same paper. The first dataset ID is the DOI for the BGC-Argo database, which is part of the paper's content. The second dataset ID is another DOI, but it's for a different paper. 

So, in the potential_dataset_ids, there are two entries: one with the DOI and another with the Accession ID. The first one is for the dataset, and the second might be a different dataset. However, the user's task is to classify the type. The first dataset is part of the BGC-Argo database, which is primary data (since it's the database used for analysis). The second dataset is another DOI, but the context doesn't specify its type. Wait, the context says ""data referring to Organelli et al. (2016a; ...)"" so maybe that's a secondary dataset? Or perhaps both are primary?

The user's instructions say that Primary is raw or processed data generated as part of this study, specifically for this study. So if the dataset is part of the BGC-Argo database, which is the dataset used for analysis, then it's primary. The second dataset is another DOI, but since it's part of the same paper, maybe it's also primary. However, the user's potential_dataset_ids include both, so I need to check which ones are actually from the paper.

The text mentions ""BGC-Argo database"" in the abstract and the context, so that's the primary dataset. The other two entries are perhaps from other papers or different datasets. So, in the JSON, I should have one dataset with type Primary and the others as Missing or maybe Secondary if they are not part of the study's data.

Wait, the user's third task says to return the dataset IDs classified as Primary or Secondary. If the first DOI is from the BGC-Argo database, which is used in the study, then it's primary. The other two entries might be from different datasets, so they would be classified as Missing or perhaps Secondary. But according to the user's potential_dataset_ids, they are there. But the user's instruction says to classify each dataset as Primary or Secondary. So if there are multiple dataset_ids, I need to check which ones are from the paper and assign their types.

In the text, the first dataset ID is used in the context of the paper's analysis. The other two entries are from other papers, so they are not part of this study's data. Therefore, the JSON should have one dataset with type Primary and the rest as Missing. But wait, the user's potential_dataset_ids include multiple entries. So, perhaps the first one is the dataset, and the others are not. Therefore, the JSON should include that dataset and leave the others as Missing.

Text Content: Abstract: The homoleptic pyrazolate complexes [CeIII 4-(Me2pz)12] and [CeIV(Me2pz)4]2 quantitatively insert CO2 to give [CeIII 4(Me2pz·CO2)12] and [CeIV(Me2pz·CO2)4], respec-tively (Me2pz = 3,5-dimethylpyrazolato).
This process is rever-sible for both complexes, as observed by in situ IR and NMR spectroscopy in solution and by TGA in the solid state.
By adjusting the molar ratio, one molecule of CO2 per [CeIV-(Me2pz)4] complex could be inserted to give trimetallic [Ce3-(Me2pz)9(Me2pz·CO2)3(thf)].
Both the cerous and ceric in-sertion products catalyze the formation of cyclic carbonates from epoxides and CO2 under mild conditions.
In the absence of epoxide, the ceric catalyst is prone to reduction by the co-catalyst tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB). .

The sulfoxides engage in metal-free C�H trifluoromethylthiolation with a range of (hetero)arenes.
The method is also applicable to the function-alization of important compound classes, such as ligand derivatives and polyaromatics, and in the late-stage trifluor-omethylthiolation of medicines and agrochemicals.

Incorporating fluorine into organic compounds is a useful tool in drug design and development.
The fluoro group is well known to improve the pharmacokinetic properties of a mol-ecule and fluorine-18 is an important radioisotope in molec-ular imaging.[1,2] Trifluoromethylthio (SCF3) groups are commonly found in drug molecules and veterinary medi-cines.[3,4]
By combining a fluorinated moiety with a hetero-atom, many have turned to the SCF3 group to impart useful properties, such as high lipophilicity, to a compound of interest.[5] .

The text also talks about fluorine improving pharmacokinetics and fluorine-18 for imaging. The potential_dataset_ids list is empty.

Now, the task is to identify citations of datasets. The first way to find dataset IDs is via DOIs. The text mentions ""data availability"" and ""data release"" but there's no specific DOI given. The second way is Accession IDs, but the text doesn't mention any. Since there are no dataset IDs mentioned in the abstract, I should return that there are no dataset citations.

Text Content: Abstract: Metal-ligand cooperativity (MLC) had a remarkable impact on transition metal chemistry and catalysis.
By use of the calix[4]pyrrolato aluminate, [1]�, which features a square-planar AlIII, we transfer this concept into the p-block and fully elucidate its mechanisms by experiment and theory.
Comple-mentary to transition metal-based MLC (aromatization upon substrate binding), substrate binding in [1]�occurs by dearomatization of the ligand.
The aluminate trapps carbonyls by the formation of C�C and Al�O bonds, but the products maintain full reversibility and outstanding dynamic exchange rates.
Remarkably, the C�C bonds can be formed or cleaved by the addition or removal of lithium cations, permitting unpre-cedented control over the system�s constitutional state.
More-over, the metal-ligand cooperative substrate interaction allows to twist the kinetics of catalytic hydroboration reactions in a unique sense.
Ultimately, this work describes the evolution of an anti-van�t Hoff/Le Bel species from their being as a struc-tural curiosity to their application as a reagent and catalyst. .

Daniel Gaissmaier,[a, b, c]
Matthias van den Borg,[a] Julian Beßner,[a] Adri C. T. van Duin,[d] and Timo Jacob*[a, b, c] One of the key challenges preventing the breakthrough of magnesium-ion batteries (MIB) is the formation of a passivating boundary layer at the Mg anode.
To describe the initial steps of Mg anode degradation by O2 impurities, a Mg/O ReaxFF (force field for reactive systems) parameter set was developed capable of accurately modeling the bulk, surface, adsorption, and diffusion properties of metallic Mg and the salt MgO. It is shown that O2 immediately dissociates upon first contact with the Mg anode (modeled as Mg(0001), Mg(101̄0)A, and Mg(101̄1)), heating the surface to several 1000 K. The high temperature assists the further oxidation and forms a rock salt interphase intersected by several grain boundaries.
Among the Mg surface terminations, Mg(101̄0)A is the most reactive, forming an MgO layer with a thickness of up to 25 Å. The trained force field can be used to model the ongoing reactions in Mg–air batteries but also to study the oxidation of magnesium metal in general. 
Introduction The search for new energy storage technologies to promote electromobility and reduce global warming is one of the greatest challenges of our time.
Magnesium-ion batteries (MIB) are attracting increasing attention as an alternative to conven-tional lithium-ion batteries (LIB) due to the unique properties of magnesium metal anodes, such as high volumetric capacity, low cost, and safe operation.[1–5] However, mass market adoption of MIBs is currently hindered by significant challenges. 
One of the biggest challenges is the formation of a passivating interface on the Mg surface which is impermeable to Mg cations and leads to battery failure.[6–8]
Sun et al. have identified three reasons for Mg degradation in a recent review article.[9] First, Mg has a higher charge density due to its bi-valency, which leads not only to stronger coordination with solvent molecules and salt anions but also facilitates solvent decom-position at the anode.[10] For example, Lu et al. have shown that the salt anion ClO4 is chemically reduced at the Mg anode in carbonate-containing solvents, forming a solid-electrolyte inter-face (SEI) consisting of Mg-halides, MgO, Mg(OH)2, MgCO3, and Mg(ROCO2)2.[11] Second, short circuits are induced by non-uniform Mg growth, which can be further subdivided into hemispherical,[12] porous,[13] or dendritic[14] growth morphologies.[9] Hemispherical 3D particles with different shapes have been detected in TFSI-based electrolytes as a function of the applied current density.[12]
In an Mg(TFSI)2 salt electrolyte with MgCl2 as additive, continuous stripping and plating leads to fracturing and reformation of the SEI .

Okay, let's start by looking at the article ID 10.1002_cssc.202201821. The text mentions a Mg/O ReaxFF potential and some references to datasets. The potential_dataset_ids provided have two entries.

First, the DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7074790. This seems like a dataset ID. The context says it's the data supporting the study. So that's a dataset. Then, the second entry is a GitHub repository: https://github.com/shk11/KVIKOp-timizer. The context mentions the KVIK optimization routine, which is an algorithm or tool. But the problem is, the user's task is to identify datasets. The first entry is a dataset (the data from Zenodo), and the second entry refers to an algorithm or tool, which might not be a dataset but a methodology. 

Wait, the first dataset ID is a dataset. The second one is a GitHub repository, which might be a dataset as well. But the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes both. However, the first entry's context mentions ""data that support the findings of this study"" which is a dataset. The second entry's context says ""KVIK optimization routine is openly available in the GitHub repository"", which might be an algorithm or tool, not a dataset. But maybe it's considered a dataset if it's a repository. However, the problem states that datasets are those with a persistent identifier. The first entry's DOI is a dataset ID, and the second entry's URL might not be a dataset ID. So the first entry is a dataset, the second is not. 

Therefore, the correct classification would be one dataset (the first) and possibly another if the second is considered a dataset. But according to the problem statement, the user's potential_dataset_ids include both. However, the first one is a dataset, and the second might not be. Wait, the second entry's context says ""the KVIK optimization routine is openly available in the GitHub repository"". If the GitHub repository is a dataset, then maybe it's a dataset. But the first entry's DOI is a dataset. So the answer would have one dataset. But maybe the second is a dataset. However, the problem says to use the given potential_dataset_ids. So the first entry is a dataset, and the second might not be. Therefore, the JSON would have that dataset classified as ""Primary"" because it's the data from the study. The second entry's context mentions an algorithm, which isn't a dataset but a tool. So the final JSON would include the first dataset_id and type ""Primary"".

The maintenance of  polyandry has been attributed to material (direct) and genetic (in-direct) benefits for females.
Direct benefits include fertility assur-ance, provision of resources and parental care for the offspring  (Sheldon 1994).
Indirect benefits include genetic incompatibility  avoidance, increased genetic diversity of offspring, and the en-hanced survival and reproductive success of offspring (Jennions  & Petrie, 2000; Neff & Pitcher, 2005; Tregenza & Wedell, 2000).

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to look at the given article ID and the text content to identify any dataset IDs. The article is about ecology and evolution, specifically discussing polyandry in the western rock lobster. The potential_dataset_ids list is empty here, which suggests that the article doesn't cite any datasets. 

Wait, but maybe I should double-check. The text mentions ""data availability"" and ""data release"" terms. The DOI format is important here. The example given is a DOI like 10.1234/xxxx.1x1x-xx11. But in the provided text, there's no DOI. The only mentions are ""data availability"" and ""dataset"", but those are general terms. 

Since the potential_dataset_ids are empty, it means no datasets are referenced. Therefore, I should return a JSON object with ""dataset_id"" as ""Missing"" and ""type"" as ""Missing"" to indicate no datasets were found. 

I need to make sure I'm not missing any other potential dataset terms. The text doesn't mention any specific dataset IDs like EPI_ISL_10271777 or similar. The focus is on the study's context rather than citing datasets. So, no dataset IDs are present here. 

Therefore, the correct response is to return the specified JSON structure with both missing entries.

2018;8:9827–9833.  ﻿   |  9827 www.ecolevol.org 1 | INTRODUCTION The fundamental biological process of sex determination has been  under intense scientific research for decades, mainly because of its  profound implications on the phenotype of individuals and the for-mation of sex ratios in natural populations (West, Reece, & Sheldon,  2002).
It is therefore a process of major evolutionary significance.  
The mechanisms of sex determination have, for a long time, been  classified discretely as either genetic (GSD) or environmental (ESD).  
However, researchers are now in agreement that genotypic and en-vironmental sex determination does not necessarily constitute a di-chotomy, but rather two extremes of a continuum (Sarre, Georges, &  Quinn, 2004). 
Sex allocation studies on birds and mammals are numerous  (reviewed in Wapstra et al., 2007) and show that the majority of  these species have genetic sex determination.

﻿   |  8945 www.ecolevol.org 1 | INTRODUCTION Migration is a ubiquitous phenomenon that has evolved as an ad‐ aptation to seasonally changing environments (Newton, 2008).  
But within the same species, or even population, we often observe  tremendous variation in specific migration features (Chapman,  Brönmark, Nilsson, & Hansson, 2011;
Flack et al., 2016).
This may  be the outcome of trade‐offs between the costs and benefits of  different migration strategies, leading to differences in individual  fitness, and subsequently influencing demographic dynamics (Lok,  Overdijk, & Piersma, 2015; Palacín, Alonso, Martín, & Alonso,  2017).
Life in the Anthropocene is challenging many ancient evo‐ lutionary adaptations including migration.
Selection pressures  change quickly, favoring individuals that are better adapted to  human‐modified landscapes (Otto, 2018).
These human‐shaped  selection pressures are caused by hunting, poisoning, electrocu‐ tion, food subsidies or global habitat and climate change, and many  more (Oro, Genovart, Tavecchia, Fowler, & Martínez‐Abraín, 2013;    Received: 18 April 2019 | Revised: 28 May 2019 | Accepted: 4 June 2019 DOI: 10.1002/ece3.5395   O R

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an article ID and a text content, along with potential dataset_ids. My job is to identify citations of datasets used in the research, classify their types as Primary or Secondary, and present the results in JSON.

First, I need to look through the text of the paper to find any dataset IDs mentioned. The text mentions ""Solidago canadensis"" and ""MN107084, MN107151"" in the context of the dataset. The context says they are from the NCBI database with accession numbers. So, MN107084 and MN107151 are the dataset IDs here.

Now, checking the dataset_ids list provided, the first entry is MN107084 and MN107151. The second entry includes MN107151, MN335287, MN335290. So, the first two dataset IDs are from the NCBI database. 

Next, I need to determine if these datasets are primary or secondary. Primary would be raw or processed data from the study, while secondary would be data reused or from existing records. Since the study is testing ploidy and climatic tolerance, and the datasets are related to the plant species, it's likely that these are raw data used in the study. Therefore, both MN107084 and MN107151 would be classified as Primary.

I should also check if there are any other dataset IDs in the list. The third entry mentions MN335287 and MN335290, but they are part of the same NCBI database. However, the user's dataset IDs list includes these, but the first two are already identified. The problem states that if multiple citations of the same dataset_id exist, process only the first one. Here, both MN107084 and MN107151 are from the same dataset, so they are considered as two separate citations for the same dataset. 

So, the final JSON should include both dataset IDs as Primary. I need to make sure there are no other dataset IDs mentioned and that the classification is accurate based on the study context.

In this 6-year study in an old-field ecosystem, we manipulated insect abundance (reduced and control), the propagule pressure of an invasive nitrogen-fixing plant (propagules added and control), and soil nutrient avail-ability (nitrogen added, nitrogen reduced and control) in a fully crossed, com-pletely randomized plot design.
We found that nutrient amendment and, occasionally, insect abundance interacted with the propagule pressure of an invasive plant to alter above- and belowground structure and function at our site.
Not surprisingly, nutrient amendment had a direct effect on aboveground biomass and soil nutrient mineralization.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an article ID and a text content, along with potential dataset_ids that need to be analyzed. The goal is to identify citations of datasets, classify their type as Primary or Secondary, and present the results in a JSON format.

First, I need to look through the text content for any mentions of datasets. The article is about ecological studies, specifically focusing on soil nutrients, invasive plants, and insects. The abstract mentions ""nutrient amendment"" and ""invasive plant"", which are terms that might correspond to dataset IDs.

Looking at the potential_dataset_ids provided, none of them seem to match the terms used in the abstract. The example dataset IDs are like DOI or Accession IDs, but the abstract talks about ecological factors and not datasets. The text doesn't mention any specific dataset identifiers like ""EPI_ISL_"" or ""SAMN_..."", so there are no dataset citations here.

Next, I need to check if there are any other terms in the text that could indicate dataset usage. The abstract states ""nutrient availability"" and ""soil enzyme activity"", which are more about environmental factors rather than datasets. The keywords don't point to specific datasets, so there's no indication of dataset citations.

Since there are no dataset_ids mentioned in the text, I should return a JSON object with ""dataset_id"" as ""Missing"" and ""type"" as ""Missing"". The user's instructions specify that if no dataset citations are found, return a single JSON object with both fields missing. That makes sense here because the text doesn't reference any datasets.

Email: z.amir@uq.edu.au Abstract Predator–­prey dynamics are a fundamental part of ecology, but directly studying inter-actions has proven difficult.
The proliferation of camera trapping has enabled the col-lection of large datasets on wildlife, but researchers face hurdles inferring interactions  from observational data.
Recent advances in hierarchical co-­abundance models infer  species interactions while accounting for two species' detection probabilities, shared  responses to environmental covariates, and propagate uncertainty throughout the  entire modeling process.
However, current approaches remain unsuitable for interact-ing specie.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an article ID and a text content, along with potential dataset IDs that are associated with the paper. My job is to identify citations of datasets, classify their type, and return the results in a specific JSON format.

First, I need to look at the text content. The article is about inferring predator-prey interactions using Bayesian co-abundance modeling. The DOI given is 10.1002/ece3.9627. The first thing to check is if this DOI is a dataset ID. The format for DOIs is usually like https://doi.org/[prefix]/[suffix], where the prefix starts with 10. and the suffix includes letters, numbers, or special characters. The DOI here is 10.1002/ece3.9627. Let me check the prefix: 10.1002/ece3.9627. The prefix is 10.1002, which matches the format, but the suffix is 9627. The DOI is for a paper, not a dataset. So this is not a dataset ID. 

Next, the potential dataset IDs list is empty. The user provided ""potential_dataset_ids: []"". So there are no dataset IDs mentioned in the text. Therefore, there are no citations of datasets to process. 

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the text again. The abstract mentions Bayesian co-abundance modeling, which is a statistical method. The DOI is for a paper, not a dataset. The dataset IDs provided in the potential list are all empty. So according to the given data, there are no dataset IDs to classify. Therefore, the JSON should have a single entry with dataset_id as ""Missing"" and type as ""Missing"".

I need to make sure that the user's instructions are followed. The first task is to identify citations of datasets. Since there are none, the second and third tasks are to return the JSON accordingly. The answer should be a single JSON object as specified.

Text Content: Abstract.   
Understanding the impact of herbivory on plant populations is a fundamental goal of ecology.  
Damage to individual plants can be visually striking and affect the fates of individuals, but these impacts  do not necessarily translate into population-­level differences in vital rates (survival, growth, or fecundity)  or population growth rates.
In biological control of weeds, quantitative assessments of population-­level  impacts of released agents on both target invasive plants and native, nontarget plants are needed to inform  evaluations of the benefits and risks of releasing agents into new regions.
Here we present a 3-­yr exper-imental demographic field study using the European root-­feeding biocontrol weevil, Mogulones crucifer,  first released in Canada in 1997 to control the invasive weed Cynoglossum officinale (Boraginaceae).
Mogu-lones crucifer is an effective “search and destroy” agent in Canada, but sporadically feeds, oviposits, and  develops on native nontarget Boraginaceae.
We investigated the population-­level impacts of this biocon-trol insect on its target weed and a native nontarget plant, Hackelia micrantha (Boraginaceae), by releasing  large numbers of weevils into naturally occurring patches of H. micrantha growing isolated from or inter-spersed with C. officinale.
We followed the fates of individual plants on release and nonrelease (control)  sites for two transition years, developed matrix models to project population growth rates (λ) for each  plant species, and examined the contributions from differences in vital rates to changes in λ using life table  response experiments (LTRE).
In contrast to studies of the insect–plant interaction in its native range, as a  biocontrol agent, M. crucifer increased mortality of C. officinale rosettes in the year immediately following  release, depressing the weed's λ to below the population replacement level.
However, λ for H. micrantha  was never depressed below the replacement level, and any differences between release and nonrelease  sites in the nontarget could not be explained by significant contributions from vital rates in the LTRE.
This  study is the first to simultaneously and experimentally examine target and nontarget population-­level im-pacts of a weed biocontrol insect in the field, and supports the theoretical prediction that plant life history  characteristics and uneven herbivore host preferences can interact to produce differences in population-­ level impacts between target and nontarget plant species. .

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided an article ID and a text content.

Hmm, but maybe there's a typo or mistake here. Let me check again.

The user wrote: ""potential_dataset_ids: []"" but in the problem statement, the potential_dataset_ids are given as a list.

The article is about a field study on a biocontrol weevil, Mogulones crucifer, affecting weeds and native plants. The text mentions ""data availability"" and ""dataset"" but there are no specific dataset IDs mentioned. The potential_dataset_ids list is empty. So according to the instructions, if there are no dataset_ids, return the JSON as specified. Therefore, the correct response would be the empty array with the missing dataset IDs. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

The abstract mentions ""data availability"" and ""dataset"", but there's no specific dataset_id in the potential_dataset_ids. So the answer should be the empty array. Therefore, the JSON would be:

But the user's potential_dataset_ids list is empty. So I need to follow the instructions exactly. The user's potential_dataset_ids is empty, so no dataset_ids found. Therefore, the JSON is as above.

Manuel T. Lerdau Abstract While insect populations are simultaneously threatened by many local- and global-scale stressors, the interacting effects of these factors remain poorly understood.
These interactions between stressors, whether additive or antagonis-tic, may have profound effects on our assumptions about and predictions for any given system.
Here we address this gap by exploring the interactive effects of introduced predators and elevated temperatures on emerging aquatic insects across alpine lakes.
Using a crossed factorial field survey, we examine whether warmer temperatures either directly affect the magnitude or diversity of insect emergence, or mediate the impacts of predation via interactions with predator presence.
Based on data from more than 11,000 insects collected across a two-year period, we find a 71% reduction in insect emergence associated with an additional 3.6�C of water temperature in oligotrophic alpine lakes.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided an article with an ID and a text content. They also have a list of potential dataset_ids and their contexts. My task is to identify citations of datasets, classify their types, and present the results in JSON.

First, I need to look through the text content. The abstract mentions data availability and a dataset from Dryad. The DOI is given as ""https://doi.org/10.25349/D9QW5X."" The first dataset ID is from Dryad. The context says it's the dataset available. So that's one dataset, type ""Primary"" since it's the data used.

Looking at the other dataset IDs, there are two more. The second one is from a different DOI, which might be another dataset. But the context says ""g/package=vegan"" which doesn't seem related to the study. The third one is from a different context, but the user might have included duplicates. However, the user mentioned that if multiple citations of the same dataset_id, process the first. So maybe there are two dataset IDs here, but the context varies. 

Wait, the third dataset's context is ""Variation in Reciprocal Subsidies between Lakes and Land: Perspectives from the Mountains of "" which seems unrelated. The fourth dataset's context is ""Piovia-Scott, J., S. Sadro, R. A. Knapp, J. Sickman, K. L. Pope, and S. Chandra. 2016."" which is also unrelated. So maybe only the first dataset ID from Dryad is relevant. 

But the user's potential_dataset_ids have multiple entries. The first one is from Dryad, the second from a different DOI, third from another, and fourth from another. However, the contexts vary. The key is to find the dataset IDs that are actually cited in the paper. The first dataset ID is clearly a citation. The others might be from different sources or duplicates. 

Since the user wants to process each dataset ID as per their context, even if the context is different, but the dataset_id is the same. So the first dataset_id is from Dryad, and the other entries might be duplicates. However, the user's task says to process the first citation of each dataset_id. So even if there are multiple entries, only the first one is considered. 

Therefore, the JSON should include the first dataset_id from Dryad as ""Primary"" and maybe the others if they are also present, but the user's potential_dataset_ids list has multiple entries. However, the user's instruction says to process the first citation of each dataset_id. So perhaps the first entry in the potential_dataset_ids list is the correct one. 

Wait, looking back at the user's potential_dataset_ids, the first entry has the dataset_id as ""https://doi.org/10.25349/D9QW5X."" and the context as ""DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT Data and novel code (Owens et al., 2023) are available from Dryad: ..."". Then the next entry is ""https://doi.org/10.10.25349/D9QW5X."" but that might be a typo. The third entry is ""https://doi.org/10.25349/D9QW5X."" again. So all these are the same dataset_id. So even though the context varies, the dataset_id is the same. 

Therefore, the correct classification would be that the first dataset_id (the same one) is Primary, and others might be duplicates. However, the user's instruction says to process the first citation of each dataset_id. Since all three potential_dataset_ids have the same dataset_id, maybe all three are considered. But the user's task says to process each dataset_id once. 

Wait, the user's potential_dataset_ids list has multiple entries with the same dataset_id. So for each of those entries, even if the context is different, they all refer to the same dataset. Therefore, all three entries would be considered, but the user's task says to process the first citation. So maybe the answer includes all three, but the user's JSON structure needs to have each dataset_id once. However, since all three are the same, perhaps only the first one is included. 

But looking at the example, the user's JSON structure expects an array of objects. So if there are multiple dataset_ids, each with their own type, but all are the same, then the array would have all three. However, the user's potential_dataset_ids list has multiple entries. 

Wait, the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes three entries, all with the same dataset_id. Therefore, the correct classification would be that all three are ""Primary"" or ""Secondary"". But since they are the same dataset, the type is the same. But the user's task says to classify each dataset as Primary or Secondary. So if there are multiple citations of the same dataset_id, they all have the same type. Therefore, the JSON array would have all three entries. 

But the user's example response shows that even if there are multiple entries, they are included. So the final JSON would include all three entries. However, the user's original potential_dataset_ids list might have duplicates. 

In any case, based on the given data, the first dataset_id is the correct one, and the others are duplicates. Therefore, the JSON array should include all three entries with ""Primary"" as the type.

Task 1: Identify citations of datasets. The text doesn't use any dataset terms like ""dataset"", ""repository"", ""data source"", etc. So there are no dataset IDs cited here. 

Task 2: Classify the type of each dataset. Since there are no dataset IDs mentioned, both ""Primary"" and ""Secondary"" are missing for each dataset. 

Task 3: Return the results in JSON. Since there are no dataset IDs, the JSON object should have ""dataset_id"": ""Missing"" and ""type"": ""Missing"".

Email: rubikraf@gmail.com Funding information Nitobe School Project Abstract Field observations on small rivers of the Amazon basin are less common due to their remote location and difficult accessibility.
Here we show, through remote sensing analysis and field works, the planform evolution and riverbed topography of a small river located in the upper foreland Amazon basin, the Ichilo River.
By tracking plan-form changes over 30 years, we identified the factors that control meander migration rates in the Ichilo River: cutoffs, climate and human interventions.
The data suggest that neck cutoffs are the main controls in the Ichilo River, with an annual density of 0.022 cutoffs/km.
In addition, climate controls have been identified in the form of high-precipitation events that may have promoted cutoffs, an increase in meander migration rate and channel widening.
The width distribution of the Ichilo River is well represented by general extreme value and inverse Gaussian distributions.
The spatio-temporal variability of meandering migration rates in the Ichilo River is analysed in two locations where neck cutoffs are expected.
Analysing the distance across the neck in these two points, we predict the occurrence of a new cutoff.
The combined methodology of bathymetric surveys and structure from motion photogrammetry shows us the Ichilo riverbed topography and banks at high resolution, where two scour holes were identified.
Finally, we discuss the impact of planform changes of the Ichilo River on communities that are established along its riverbanks.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided an article with an ID and a text, along with a list of potential dataset_ids and their contexts. My task is to identify citations of datasets, classify their types, and present the results in JSON.

First, I need to look through the text of the paper to see where datasets might be mentioned. The abstract mentions field observations, remote sensing, and data analysis. The text also includes some DOI links and Accession IDs. 

Looking at the potential_dataset_ids, the first entry has a DOI: https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.5058. The context here is ""Environ."" and another entry has a DOI linked to a paper by James et al. Then there's another dataset with a DOI linked to a paper by Lanzoni and Seminara. 

Wait, the text mentions ""data availability"" in the abstract, but the DOI is for the paper. The user's instructions say to look for DOIs as dataset_ids. So the first dataset ID I found is from the DOI in the text. Let me check if there are any other dataset IDs. The second entry has a DOI from the same paper, but the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes that as well. But the context says ""Environ."" and another entry under ""44(10), 2081–2084."" So maybe there are multiple citations here. 

Wait, the user's potential_dataset_ids list has three entries. The first one is the DOI from the paper, the second one is the same DOI, and the third has a different DOI. So there are two dataset IDs here. The first two entries are the same DOI. But according to the instructions, if multiple citations of the same dataset_id, only the first one is considered. So the first dataset ID is from the first entry, and the second is the same DOI. But maybe the second entry is a different dataset. Let me check the context again. 

The first entry's context is ""Environ."" and the second's is ""44(10), 2081–2084."" The third entry's context is ""erto Villarroel, Bolivia, May 23–24, 2019."" So the third entry's DOI is from a different paper. 

So, there are two dataset IDs here. The first one is from the DOI in the text, and the second one is the same DOI. But the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes both. So in the JSON, I need to list both. However, the user's instructions say to process the first citation of each dataset_id. Since there are two citations for the same DOI, but the first one is processed. 

Wait, the first entry's context is ""Environ."" and the second's is ""44(10), 2081–2084."" The third entry's context is about a different paper. So the first dataset ID is from the first entry, and the second is the same DOI. But the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes both. So in the JSON, I should include both dataset IDs. 

Therefore, the JSON should have two entries: one with the first dataset ID and one with the second. Each with their type. The first dataset is from the DOI, which is a primary dataset since it's data from the study. The second is the same DOI, so same type. But according to the instructions, if multiple citations of the same dataset_id, process only the first. So even though there are two citations, only the first one is considered. 

So the final JSON would have two entries: one for each dataset ID found. Each with the type ""Primary"" since they are data from the study. Let me check the original text again. The data mentions remote sensing analysis and field works, which are primary data. The bathymetric surveys and photogrammetry data are also primary. So both dataset IDs are primary.

DP170103350 Abstract The 20 May 2016 MW 6.1 Petermann earthquake in central Australia generated a 21 km surface rupture with 0.1 to 1 m vertical displacements across a low-relief landscape.
No paleo-scarps or potentially analogous topographic features are evident in pre-earthquake Worldview-1 and Worldview-2 satellite data.
Two excavations across the surface rupture expose near-surface fault geometry and mixed aeolian-sheetwash sediment faulted only in the 2016 earthquake.
A 10.6 ± 0.4 ka optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age of sheetwash sediment provides a minimum estimate for the period of quiescence prior to 2016 rupture.
Seven cosmogenic beryllium-10 (10Be) bedrock erosion rates are derived for samples < 5 km distance from the surface rupture on the hanging-wall and foot-w.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided an article with ID 10.1002_esp.5090 and a text content. They also have a list of potential_dataset_ids with their contexts. My task is to identify citations of datasets, classify each type (Primary or Secondary), and present the results in JSON.

First, I need to look through the text of the paper to find any dataset references. The text mentions ""optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age of sheetwash sediment"" which looks like a dataset. The DOI here is https://doi.org/10.1080/08120090802546977. That's a dataset_id. Then there's another DOI: https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04428. That seems like a citation for a different paper, but maybe a secondary dataset? Wait, the context says ""derived for samples < 5 km distance from the surface rupture on the hanging-wall and foot-wall."" So that's a dataset from a different study. Then there's another DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0264-3707. This seems like a dataset from USGS. Also, there's a URL for USGS Bulletin 2032-B. 

Now, I need to check if these are dataset_ids. The first two DOIs look like standard DOIs. The third one is from the USGS, which is a repository, so that's a dataset. The fourth one is from the USGS as well. The fifth one is from McCalpin's dataset. 

Each of these should be classified as Primary or Secondary. The first dataset (OSL age) is likely a primary dataset since it's directly related to the study. The second is a secondary because it's from another study. The USGS datasets are primary as well. So the JSON should include these three datasets. Let me make sure I didn't miss any. The text mentions two excavations, which might indicate data from the same study, so that's a primary dataset. The other two are from different studies, so secondary. 

So the JSON would have each dataset with their type, and the list should include all three. I need to format it correctly, ensuring that if no datasets are found, the JSON is missing. In this case, there are three datasets, so the JSON should list them.

The other dataset IDs in the list are not relevant here. The second part of the potential_dataset_ids has other DOIs, but they don't relate to the study. The third one is about a dataset from a conference, which is a different context.

Now, I need to make sure there are no other dataset IDs mentioned. The text mentions 402 CT scans, but the DOI is the only one. The classification should be Primary for the PleThora dataset since it's the dataset used for the study. The other entries in the potential_dataset_ids are not relevant here.

Putting it all together, the JSON should include the dataset_id and type for the found dataset. Since there's only one dataset found, the JSON array will have that object. I need to ensure that if there are multiple datasets, they are listed, but in this case, only one is present.

Text Content: Abstract Objective: Silver Chub Macrhybopsis storeriana, a predominately riverine species  throughout its native range, exists within Lake Erie as the only known lake popu-lation.
Its population declined in the 1950s and never fully recovered.
Canada has  listed Silver Chub in the Great Lakes–­St.
Lawrence River as endangered and has  initiated a recovery plan that recognized the identification of spawning areas as a  critical component to inform Silver Chub's recovery potential. 
Methods: We investigated potential spawning locations of Silver Chub using cap-ture records, otolith microchemistry, and daily age analysis.
Lapillus otolith
Sr:Ca ra-tios from 27 age-­0 Silver Chub were used to identify potential spawning areas.
Daily  ages estimated from lapilli were used to calculate hatch dates, which then were com-pared with capture data of adults and river flows to further inform potential spawn-ing areas. 
Result: The Detroit River (and its nearshore area) was all but ruled out as a potential  spawning location.
The Maumee, Portage, and Sandusky rivers or their nearshore  areas were all possible spawning locations.
Projected hatch dates spanned the end  of May through the end of June and occurred across a wide range of flows, although  some peaks in hatch dates corresponded to flow peaks, indicating recruitment is po-tentially enhanced by high flows. 
Conclusion: Silver Chub spawning period and hypothesized spawning rivers or  lacustuaries overlap those of invasive Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, creat-ing a need to jointly consider Grass Carp control efforts with conservation of Silver  Chub when assessing management alternatives.
Further research on spawning  guild and the use of rivers themselves or nearshore areas influenced by rivers as  spawning areas are required to maximize potential for conservation and recovery  of Silver Chub. .

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided an article ID and a text content, along with potential_dataset_ids that contain dataset IDs and their context. My task is to identify all citations of datasets, classify their types as Primary or Secondary, and present the results in JSON.

First, I need to look through the text and see where dataset IDs are mentioned. The first thing I notice is the DOI in the abstract. The text mentions ""Silver Chub Macrhybopsis storeriana"" as the species, and then references a doctoral dissertation. The DOI is https://doi.org/10.5066/P9GTUMAY. The context here is the dissertation, which is a dataset. Since the DOI is a dataset identifier, I can classify that as a Primary dataset because it's the data used for the study.

Next, there's another DOI: https://doi.org/10.5066/F75M63X0. The context here is about the research on Grass Carp eggs in the Sandusky River. The dataset is the U.S. Geological Survey data release, so that's also a Primary dataset.

Wait, but the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes both of these. I need to check if there are any other dataset IDs mentioned. The text also mentions a PhD dissertation, but the DOI is the dataset. Then, the second DOI refers to a study on newly hatched Grass Carp, which again is a dataset. 

So, each of these two DOIs is a dataset. The first one is for the dissertation, the second for the Grass Carp research. Both are Primary datasets because they are raw or processed data generated for the study. The user's task is to return the JSON with these datasets. 

I need to ensure that each dataset is correctly identified and classified. Since there are two citations, each contributing to a dataset, the JSON should include both entries. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided an article ID and a text content. They also have a list of potential dataset_ids and their context within the paper. My job is to identify citations of datasets, classify their types (Primary or Secondary), and return them in JSON.

First, looking at the article ID: 10.1007_jhep07(2018)134. The text mentions measurements of Υ mesons' production cross-sections in proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV. The data sample is from LHCb at 2015. The abstract talks about measuring cross-sections using a dataset. But the potential_dataset_ids list is empty. Wait, maybe there's no dataset mentioned here. The text doesn't mention any dataset IDs like DOIs or Accession IDs. 

So, according to task 1, I need to check if there are any dataset citations. The text doesn't use any dataset terms like ""dataset"", ""repository"", ""data release"", etc. It's just about measuring cross-sections. Therefore, no dataset citations are found. 

Task 2: Since there are no dataset IDs mentioned, all datasets are ""Missing"" in both type. The third task requires a JSON object if no datasets are found. The example shows a single object with both dataset_id and type as ""Missing"". 

Wait, but maybe I should check again. The text says ""the data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity..."" which could imply data, but the potential_dataset_ids list is empty. So no dataset IDs are cited here. 

Therefore, the correct JSON would have a single object with dataset_id and type both missing. That's the answer.
