<passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><text>Cancer cell secretomes are considered a potential source for the discovery of cancer markers. In this study, the secretomes of four breast cancer (BC) cell lines (Hs578T, MCFâ7, MDAâMBâ231, and SKâBRâ3) were profiled with liquid chromatographyâtandem mass spectrometry analysis. A total of 1410 proteins were identified with less than 1% false discovery rate, of which approximately 55% (796 proteins) were predicted to be secreted from cells. To find BCâspecific proteins among the secreted proteins, data of immunohistochemical staining compiled in the Human Protein Atlas were investigated by comparing the data of BC tissues with those of normal tissues. By applying various criteria, including higher expression level in BC tissues, higher predicted potential of secretion, and sufficient number of tandem mass spectra, 12 biomarker candidate proteins including ganglioside GM2 activator (GM2A) were selected for confirmation. Western blot analysis and ELISA for plasma samples of healthy controls and BC patients revealed elevation of GM2A in BC patients, especially those who were estrogen receptorânegative. Additionally, siRNAâmediated knockdown of GM2A in BC cells decreased migration in vitro, whereas the overexpression of GM2A led to an increase in cell migration. Although GM2A as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in BC should be carefully verified further, this study has established the potential role of GM2A in BC progression.</text></passage>

<article-title>PleThora: Pleural effusion and thoracic cavity segmentations in diseased lungs for benchmarking chest CT processing pipelines</article-title>

<abstract id="mp14424-abs-0001"><p>This manuscript describes a dataset of thoracic cavity segmentations and discrete pleural effusion segmentations we have annotated on 402 computed tomography (CT) scans acquired from patients with non&#x02010;small cell lung cancer. The segmentation of these anatomic regions precedes fundamental tasks in image analysis pipelines such as lung structure segmentation, lesion detection, and radiomics feature extraction. Bilateral thoracic cavity volumes and pleural effusion volumes were manually segmented on CT scans acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive &#x0201c;NSCLC Radiomics&#x0201d; data collection. Four hundred and two thoracic segmentations were first generated automatically by a U&#x02010;Net based algorithm trained on chest CTs without cancer, manually corrected by a medical student to include the complete thoracic cavity (normal, pathologic, and atelectatic lung parenchyma, lung hilum, pleural effusion, fibrosis, nodules, tumor, and other anatomic anomalies), and revised by a radiation oncologist or a radiologist. Seventy&#x02010;eight pleural effusions were manually segmented by a medical student and revised by a radiologist or radiation oncologist. Interobserver agreement between the radiation oncologist and radiologist corrections was acceptable. All expert&#x02010;vetted segmentations are publicly available in NIfTI format through The Cancer Imaging Archive at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7937/tcia.2020.6c7y-gq39">https://doi.org/10.7937/tcia.2020.6c7y&#x02010;gq39</ext-link>. Tabular data detailing clinical and technical metadata linked to segmentation cases are also available. Thoracic cavity segmentations will be valuable for developing image analysis pipelines on pathologic lungs &#x02014; where current automated algorithms struggle most. In conjunction with gross tumor volume segmentations already available from &#x0201c;NSCLC Radiomics,&#x0201d; pleural effusion segmentations may be valuable for investigating radiomics profile differences between effusion and primary tumor or training algorithms to discriminate between them.</p></abstract>

'{"title": "Decentralized collaborative multi-institutional PET attenuation and scatter correction using federated deep learning", "abstract": "Purpose Attenuation correction and scatter compensation (AC/SC) are two main steps toward quantitative PET imaging, which remain challenging in PET-only and PET/MRI systems. These can be effectively tackled via deep learning (DL) methods. However, trustworthy, and generalizable DL models commonly require well-curated, heterogeneous, and large datasets from multiple clinical centers. At the same time, owing to legal/ethical issues and privacy concerns, forming a large collective, centralized dataset poses significant challenges. In this work, we aimed to develop a DL-based model in a multicenter setting without direct sharing of data using federated learning (FL) for AC/SC of PET images. Methods Non-attenuation/scatter corrected and CT-based attenuation/scatter corrected (CT-ASC)  18 F-FDG PET images of 300 patients were enrolled in this study. The dataset consisted of 6 different centers, each with 50 patients, with scanner, image acquisition, and reconstruction protocols varying across the centers. CT-based ASC PET images served as the standard reference. All images were reviewed to include high-quality and artifact-free PET images. Both corrected and uncorrected PET images were converted to standardized uptake values (SUVs). We used a modified nested U-Net utilizing residual U-block in a U-shape architecture. We evaluated two FL models, namely sequential (FL-SQ) and parallel (FL-PL) and compared their performance with the baseline centralized (CZ) learning model wherein the data were pooled to one server, as well as center-based (CB) models where for each center the model was built and evaluated separately. Data from each center were divided to contribute to training (30 patients), validation (10 patients), and test sets (10 patients). Final evaluations and reports were performed on 60 patients (10 patients from each center).
