Text Content: ABSTRACT.
In the frame of the IAEA-CRP (Coordinated Research Projects): Enhancing Nuclear Analytical Techniques to Meet the Needs of Forensic Sciences, an intercomparison exercise was organized between three AMS laboratories.
Aim of the program is to promote the use of nuclear and accelerator-based techniques in routine forensics practice.
In this view, one of the key points is the assessment of the precision and accuracy levels achievable on material of forensic interest.
We review the general structure and status of the project, with emphasis on results obtained in the analysis of wines of different grape varieties and grounded coffee beans from different locations such as Brazil, Spain, and Italy.
The three laboratories processed the samples according to different chemical protocols and performed the 14C measurements using different systems: MICADAS in Zurich and Debrecen and a HVEE 4130HC 3 MV Tandetron in Lecce.
Within the quoted uncertainty, the results showed good reproducibility, indicating that uncertainty level of the order of 0.3% are achieved by AMS on a single sample while multiple sample analyses results in precision down to 0.1–0.2%.
The measured 14C concentrations on coffee and wine samples resulted to be consistent with atmospheric 14C levels in the growing years. .

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an article with an ID and a text abstract. They also have a list of potential_dataset_ids and a context where the datasets are mentioned. My job is to identify citations of datasets, classify their types, and return the results in JSON.

First, I need to look through the text of the paper to see where dataset IDs are mentioned. The abstract mentions three laboratories, their analysis methods, and results. The potential_dataset_ids include a few entries, but I need to check if they correspond to the datasets used in the paper.

Looking at the first dataset ID: https://doi.org/10.11588/data/10100. The context says it's from the ""Heidelberg Research Data Repository"" in the context of L, Fedi M, Friedrich R, Maspero F, Sava T. 2019. The paper is about radiocarbon dating and the protection of cultural heritage. The DOI seems to be for a dataset related to radiocarbon dating. 

Then there's another entry: https://doi.org/10.11588/data/10100 heiDATA: ... which also points to the same repository. The context here is about the study's methods and data collection. 

I need to check if these DOIs are specific to the datasets used in the paper. The first dataset is about radiocarbon dating, which is a technique used in the study. The second dataset is part of the repository, which might be a database or archive where the data are stored. 

Now, the task is to classify these datasets as Primary or Secondary. Primary would be raw data generated in the study, while Secondary would be data reused from existing sources. Since the study involved processing samples using specific protocols, and the data were collected from those protocols, the first dataset seems to be a raw dataset used for analysis. The second dataset might be a database or archive, which could be secondary if it's data from another study or dataset. 

But wait, the first dataset ID is mentioned in the context of the study's methods. The first dataset is likely the raw data used in the analysis. The second dataset might be a secondary dataset since it's part of the repository. 

Therefore, the JSON should include both dataset IDs with their respective types. The first dataset is Primary, and the second is Secondary. The user needs to return them in a JSON array. Let me make sure there are no other dataset IDs to consider. The potential_dataset_ids list has two entries, both pointing to the same repository, so they are the same dataset. So only those two entries need to be considered. 

Wait, but the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes two entries, but the text mentions both. So I need to process both. The first dataset is from the first entry, and the second is from the heiDATA entry. Both are the same dataset, so the first one is Primary, and the second is Secondary. 

Putting it all together, the JSON should have two entries with their respective types.

Text Content: Abstract Like much of the European centre-left, Britain’s Labour Party has struggled to appeal to its former core working class support base in recent years.
However, this is largely a failure to connect with the ‘white working class’ (WWC) specifically, whereas support among ethnic minorities remains robust.
We hypothesise that Labour could be experiencing a ‘trade-off’, whereby efforts to cater to minorities harm its perceived ability to represent WWC interests.
We test this thesis by examining whether WWC voters are more likely to view minority and working class representation in zero-sum terms and shun Labour when they associate the party with minority interests.
We show that the WWC are somewhat less likely to view working class and ethnic minority representation as strongly correlated, and Labour’s perceived ability to represent minorities is negatively associated with WWC support.
This is not (primarily) about ethnocentrism.
Instead, we suggest that ‘relative political deprivation’ is crucial. .

Okay, let's start by looking at the article ID provided: 10.1017_s0007123423000601. The text content is about the Labour Party's struggles with its working class support base and the concept of a trade-off. The abstract mentions that the study examines how WWC voters perceive minority and working class representation and their likelihood to shun Labour when associated with minority interests.

Now, the potential_dataset_ids given are a list with one entry: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FWCKSE, which is a Digital Object Identifier (DOI). The context here says it's a ""data availability statement"" and mentions replication data in Harvard Dataverse. 

The first task is to identify all citations of datasets. Since this is a DOI, it's likely the dataset_id. The second task is to classify the type as Primary or Secondary. The abstract doesn't mention any datasets in the context, so maybe both are missing. But since the potential_dataset_ids include this DOI, we should process it. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to classify each dataset_id as Primary or Secondary. If there's only one dataset_id here, and the context is about data availability, perhaps it's considered Primary data because it's used for replication. However, the abstract doesn't explicitly state it's a dataset, just that it's a data availability statement. 

So, the JSON should include the dataset_id and type. Since there's only one dataset_id here, even though the abstract doesn't mention it as a dataset, the potential_dataset_ids include it. Therefore, the JSON would have the dataset_id as the provided DOI and type as Primary, assuming it's replication data.
