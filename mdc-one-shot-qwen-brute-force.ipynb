Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus, 1758), the diamondback moth (DBM), is a well-known and destructive insect pest of brassicaceous crops worldwide. Here, we analyzed the functional responses of four spiders (Araneae) \\\\u2013 Ebrechtella tricuspidata (Fabricius, 1775) (Thomisidae), Pardosa laura (Karsch, 1879) (Lycosidae), Pardosa astrigera (Koch, 1878) (Lycosidae), and Pardosa pseudoannulata (B\\\\u00f6senberg & Strand, 1906) (Lycosidae) \\\\u2013 on P. xylostella larvae. We also analyzed intraspecific disturbances in the predation reaction and the intensity of scrambling competition of the spiders to P. xylostella larvae. Our results demonstrated that the functional responses of four spiders of different genera were in line with the Holling II model. Two Lycosidae spiders (P. astrigera and P. pseudoannulata) had the potential to control P. xylostella, and female and male spiders that belonged to the same species had different functional responses to P. xylostella. The functional responses of female predation of P. astrigena, P. laura, and P. pseudoannulata was stronger than the males, but male E. tricuspidatus had stronger functional responses to predation than females. We used the Hassell model to describe the intraspecific disturbance experiments of four spiders. There were intraspecific disturbances in the predation reactions of spiders, indicating that the predation ratio of spiders decreased in relation to the increase of its density, and with the increase of spider density, the intensity of scrambling competition of the spider increased.\\\\n      \",\"data_availability\":\"\",\"other_dataset_citations\":[]}'"

In decapods (crabs, lobsters, crayfish, and prawns), rates of polyandry are likely to be variable, but the extent to which patterns of multiple paternity reflect multiple mating, and thus are shaped by postmating processes that bias fertilization toward one or a subset of mated males, is unclear. Here, we use microsatellite markers to examine the frequency of multiple mating (the presence of spermatophores from two or more males) and patterns of paternity in wild populations of western rock lobster ( Panulirus cygnus ). Our data confirm that >45% of females had attached spermatophores arising from at least two males (i.e., confirming polyandry), but we found very limited evidence for multiple paternity; among 24 clutches sampled in this study, only two arose from fertilizations by two or more males. Single inferred paternal genotypes accounted for all remaining progeny genotypes in each clutch, including several instances when the mother had been shown to mate with two or more males. These findings highlight the need for further work to understand whether polyandry is adaptive and to uncover the mechanisms underlying postmating paternity biases in this system.\",\"data_availability\":\"\",\"other_dataset_citations\":[]}"

Although many species in this group show temperature\\u2010dependent sex determination ( TSD ), recent evidence suggests additional genetic or epigenetic effects. A proposed model explaining the adaptive significance and evolution of  TSD  in short\\u2010lived agamids predicts that selection will favor temperature\\u2010biased sex ratios in species with intense male\\u2010male competition. Here, we use experimental incubation at (near) constant temperatures to test whether the sex of Australian painted dragons ( Ctenophorus pictus ) is influenced by temperature, building on previous research yet to have reached an agreement regarding the role of temperature in this species. In this study, incubation temperature and parental identity affected hatchling sex suggesting that environment and genetics may work in concert to determine sex in this species. Although our results are consistent with  TSD , our data cannot rule out a temperature\\u2010by\\u2010sex effect on egg or hatchling mortality.

Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) in particular have exhibited great utility for phylogenomic analyses, with the software package  phyluce  being among the most utilized pipelines for UCE phylogenomics, including probe design. Despite the success of UCEs, it is becoming increasing apparent that diverse lineages require probe sets tailored to focal taxa in order to improve locus recovery. However, factors affecting probe design and methods for optimizing probe sets to focal taxa remain underexplored. Here, we use newly available beetle (Coleoptera) genomic resources to investigate factors affecting UCE probe set design using  phyluce . In particular, we explore the effects of stringency during initial design steps, as well as base genome choice on resulting probe sets and locus recovery. We found that both base genome choice and initial bait design stringency parameters greatly alter the number of resultant probes included in final probe sets and strongly affect the number of loci detected and recovered during in silico testing of these probe sets. In addition, we identify attributes of base genomes that correlated with high performance in probe design. Ultimately, we provide a recommended workflow for using  phyluce  to design an optimized UCE probe set that will work across a targeted lineage, and use our findings to develop a new, open\\u2010source UCE probe set for beetles of the suborder Adephaga.\",\"data_availability\":\"\",\"other_dataset_citations\":[]}"

Faced with these new challenges, species with diverse and flexible migratory behaviors may suffer less from population decline, as they may be better at responding to these changes by altering their migratory behavior. At the individual level, variations in migratory behavior may lead to differences in fitness and subsequently influence the population's demographic dynamics. Using lifetime GPS bio\\u2010logging data from 169 white storks ( Ciconia ciconia ), we explore whether the recently shortened migration distance of storks affects their survival during different stages of their juvenile life. We also explore how other variations in migratory decisions (i.e., time, destination), movement activity (measured using overall body dynamic acceleration), and early life conditions influence juvenile survival. We observed that their first autumn migration was the riskiest period for juvenile white storks. Individuals that migrated shorter distances and fledged earlier experienced lower mortality risks. In addition, higher movement activity and overwintering \\u201ccloser\\u2010to\\u2010home\\u201d (with 84.21% of the tracked individuals stayed Europe or North Africa) were associated with higher survival. Our study shows how avian migrants can change life history decisions over only a few decades, and thus it helps us to understand and predict how migrants respond to the rapidly changing world.\",\"data_availability\":\"\",\"other_dataset_citations\":[\"{\\\"dataset_ids\\\": ['10.5441/001/1.ck04mn78'], context: \\\"Fiedler ,  W. \\n ,  \\n Flack ,  A. \\n ,  \\n Sch\\u00e4fle ,  W. \\n ,  \\n Keeves ,  B. \\n ,  \\n Quetting ,  M. \\n ,  \\n Eid ,  B. \\n , \\u2026  \\n Wikelski ,  M. \\n  ( 2019 ).

         "{\"title\":\"Efficacy of metabarcoding for identification of fish eggs evaluated with mock communities\",\"abstract\":\"Abstract There is urgent need for effective and efficient monitoring of marine fish populations. Monitoring eggs and larval fish may be more informative\\u00a0than that traditional fish surveys since ichthyoplankton surveys reveal the reproductive activities of fish populations, which directly impact their population trajectories. Ichthyoplankton surveys have turned to molecular methods (DNA barcoding & metabarcoding) for identification of eggs and larval fish due to challenges of morphological identification. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of using metabarcoding methods on mock communities of known fish egg DNA. We constructed six mock communities with known ratios of species. In addition, we analyzed two samples from a large field collection of fish eggs and compared metabarcoding results with traditional DNA barcoding results. We examine the ability of our metabarcoding methods to detect species and relative proportion of species identified in each mock community. We found that our metabarcoding methods were able to detect species at very low input proportions; however, levels of successful detection depended on the markers used in amplification, suggesting that the use of multiple markers is desirable. Variability in our quantitative results may result from amplification bias as well as interspecific variation in mitochondrial DNA copy number. Our results demonstrate that there remain significant challenges to using metabarcoding for estimating proportional species composition; however, the results provide important insights into understanding how to interpret metabarcoding data. This study will aid in the continuing development of efficient molecular methods of biological monitoring for fisheries management.\",\"data_availability\":\"\",\"other_dataset_citations\":[]}"

The different locomotor modes are likely to be linked to anatomical specializations of the skeleton within the typical frog Bauplan. While such anatomical adaptations of the hind limbs and the pelvic girdle are comparably well understood, the pectoral girdle received much less attention in the past. We tested for locomotor\\u2010mode\\u2010related shape differences in the pectoral girdle bones of 64 anuran species by means of micro\\u2010computed\\u2010tomography\\u2010based geometric morphometrics. The pectoral girdles of selected species were analyzed with regard to the effects of shape differences on muscle moment arms across the shoulder joint and stress dissipation within the coracoid. Phylogenetic relationships, size, and locomotor behavior have an effect on the shape of the pectoral girdle in anurans, but there are differences in the relative impact of these factors between the bones of this skeletal unit. Remarkable shape diversity has been observed within locomotor groups indicating many\\u2010to\\u2010one mapping of form onto function. Significant shape differences have mainly been related to the overall pectoral girdle geometry and the shape of the coracoid. Most prominent shape differences have been found between burrowing and nonburrowing species with headfirst and backward burrowing species significantly differing from one another and from the other locomotor groups. The pectoral girdle shapes of burrowing species have generally larger moment arms for (simulated) humerus retractor muscles across the shoulder joint, which might be an adaptation to the burrowing behavior. The mechanisms of how the moment arms were enlarged differed between species and were associated with differences in the reaction of the coracoid to simulated loading by physiologically relevant forces.\",\"data_availability\":\"\",\"other_dataset_citations\":[\"{\\\"dataset_ids\\\": ['10.1007/s00435-017-0386-3'], context: \\\"Engelkes ,  K. \\n ,  \\n Friedrich ,  F. \\n ,  \\n Hammel ,  J.

The introduction of invasive nitrogen-fixing plant propagules interacted with nutrient amendment and insect presence to alter soil bacterial abundance and the activity of the microbial community. While the larger-scale, longer-term bulk measurements such as biomass production and nutrient mineralization responded to the direct effects of our treatments, the shorter-term and dynamic microbial communities tended to respond to interactions among our treatments.

Recent advances in hierarchical co\\u2010abundance models infer species interactions while accounting for two species' detection probabilities, shared responses to environmental covariates, and propagate uncertainty throughout the entire modeling process. However, current approaches remain unsuitable for interacting species whose natural densities differ by an order of magnitude and have contrasting detection probabilities, such as predator\\u2013prey interactions, which introduce zero inflation and overdispersion in count histories. Here, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical N\\u2010mixture co\\u2010abundance model that is suitable for inferring predator\\u2013prey interactions. We accounted for excessive zeros in count histories using an informed zero\\u2010inflated Poisson distribution in the abundance formula and accounted for overdispersion in count histories by including a random effect per sampling unit and sampling occasion in the detection probability formula.

We highlight its utility using 20 camera trapping datasets from 10 tropical forest landscapes in Southeast Asia and estimate four predator\\u2013prey relationships between tigers, clouded leopards, and muntjac and sambar deer. Tigers had a negative effect on muntjac abundance, providing support for top\\u2010down regulation, while clouded leopards had a positive effect on muntjac and sambar deer, likely driven by shared responses to unmodelled covariates like hunting.

Using a crossed factorial field survey, we examine whether warmer temperatures either directly affect the magnitude or diversity of insect emergence, or mediate the impacts of predation via interactions with predator presence.

Combining our results with regional studies of predator communities to identify mechanisms suggests that the interaction effects between temperature and predator presence are likely due to changes in predator behavior across temperatures.

No paleo\\u2010scarps or potentially analogous topographic features are evident in pre\\u2010earthquake Worldview\\u20101 and Worldview\\u20102 satellite data. Two excavations across the surface rupture expose near\\u2010surface fault geometry and mixed aeolian\\u2010sheetwash sediment faulted only in the 2016 earthquake. A 10.6 \\u00b1 0.4 ka optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age of sheetwash sediment provides a minimum estimate for the period of quiescence prior to 2016 rupture. Seven cosmogenic beryllium\\u201010 ( 10 Be) bedrock erosion rates are derived for samples < 5 km distance from the surface rupture on the hanging\\u2010wall and foot\\u2010wall, and three from samples 19 to 50\\u2009km from the surface rupture. No distinction is found between fault proximal rates (1.3 \\u00b1 0.1 to 2.6 \\u00b1 0.2 m Myr \\u22121 ) and distal samples (1.4 \\u00b1 0.1 to 2.3 \\u00b1 0.2 m Myr \\u22121 ). The thickness of rock fragments (2\\u20135 cm) coseismically displaced in the Petermann earthquake perturbs the steady\\u2010state bedrock erosion rate by only 1 to 3%, less than the erosion rate uncertainty estimated for each sample (7\\u201312%). Using  10 Be erosion rates and scarp height measurements we estimate approximately 0.5 to 1 Myr of differential erosion is required to return to pre\\u2010earthquake topography. By inference any pre\\u20102016 fault\\u2010related topography likely required a similar time for removal. We conclude that the Petermann earthquake was the first on this fault in the last ca. 0.5\\u20131 Myr. Extrapolating single nuclide erosion rates across this timescale introduces large uncertainties, and we cannot resolve whether 2016 represents the first ever surface rupture on this fault, or a\\u2009> 1 Myr interseismic period. Either option reinforces the importance of including distributed earthquake sources in fault displacement and seismic hazard analyses.\",\"data_availability\":\"\",\"other_dataset_citations\":[\"{\\\"dataset_ids\\\": ['10.1080/08120090802546977'], context: \\\"Constraints on the current rate of deformation and surface uplift of the Australian continent from a new seismic database and low\\u2010T thermochronological data|Australian Journal of Earth Sciences|https://doi.org/10.1080/08120090802546977\\\"}\",\"{\\\"dataset_ids\\\": ['10.1177/0959683613515732'], context: \\\"Late\\u2010Holocene climatic variability indicated by three natural archives in arid southern Australia|Holocene|https://doi.org/10.1177/0959683613515732\\\"}\"]}"

PET-only and PET/MRI systems.\\nThese can be effectively tackled via deep learning (DL)  methods.\\nHowever, trustworthy, and generalizable DL models commonly require well-curated, heterogeneous, and large  datasets from multiple clinical centers.\\nAt the same time, owing to legal/ethical issues and privacy concerns, forming a  large collective, centralized dataset poses significant challenges.\\nIn this work, we aimed to develop a DL-based model in a  multicenter setting without direct sharing of data using federated learning (FL) for AC/SC of PET images. \\nMethods Non-attenuation/scatter corrected and CT-based attenuation/scatter corrected (CT-ASC) 18F-FDG PET images  of 300 patients were enrolled in this study.\\nThe dataset consisted of 6 different centers, each with 50 patients, with scan-ner, image acquisition, and reconstruction protocols varying across the centers.\\nCT-based ASC PET images served as the  standard reference.\\nAll images were reviewed to include high-quality and artifact-free PET images.\\nBoth corrected and  uncorrected PET images were converted to standardized uptake values (SUVs).\\nWe used a modified nested U-Net utilizing  residual U-block in a U-shape architecture.\\nWe evaluated two FL models, namely sequential (FL-SQ) and parallel (FL-PL)  and compared their performance with the baseline centralized (CZ) learning model wherein the data were pooled to one  server, as well as center-based (CB) models where for each center the model was built and evaluated separately.\\nData from  each center were divided to contribute to training (30 patients), validation (10 patients), and test sets (10 patients).\\nFinal  evaluations and reports were performed on 60 patients (10 patients from each center). \\nResults In terms of percent SUV absolute relative error (ARE%), both FL-SQ (CI:12.21\\u201314.81%) and FL-PL (CI:11.82\\u2013 13.84%) models demonstrated excellent agreement with the centralized framework (CI:10.32\\u201312.00%), while FL-based  algorithms improved model performance by over 11% compared to CB training strategy (CI: 22.34\\u201326.10%).\\nFurthermore,  the Mann\\u2013Whitney test between different strategies revealed no significant differences between CZ and FL-based algorithms  (p-value > 0.05) in center-categorized mode.\\nAt the same time, a significant difference was observed between the different  training approaches on the overall dataset (p-value < 0.05).\\nIn addition, voxel-wise comparison, with respect to reference  CT-ASC, exhibited similar performance for images predicted by CZ (R2 = 0.94), FL-SQ (R2 = 0.93), and FL-PL (R2 = 0.92),  while CB model achieved a far lower coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.74).\\nDespite the strong correlations between CZ  and FL-based methods compared to reference CT-ASC, a slight underestimation of predicted voxel values was observed. \\nConclusion Deep learning-based models provide promising results toward quantitative PET image reconstruction.\\nSpecifically,  we developed two FL models and compared their performance with center-based and centralized models.\\nThe proposed FL-based models achieved higher performance compared to center-based models, comparable with centralized models.\\nOur work  provided strong empirical evidence that the FL framework can fully benefit from the generalizability and robustness of DL  models used for AC/SC in PET, while obviating the need for the direct sharing of datasets between clinical imaging centers. \",\"data_availability\":\"Data availability Data are

         "{\"title\":\"Genetic associations with micronutrient levels identified in immune and gastrointestinal networks\",\"abstract\":\"The discovery of vitamins and clarification of their role in preventing frank essential nutrient deficiencies occurred in the early 1900s. Much vitamin research has understandably focused on public health and the effects of single nutrients to alleviate acute conditions. The physiological processes for maintaining health, however, are complex systems that depend upon interactions between multiple nutrients, environmental factors, and genetic makeup. To analyze the relationship between these factors and nutritional health, data were obtained from an observational, community-based participatory research program of children and teens (age 6\\u201314) enrolled in a summer day camp in the Delta region of Arkansas. Assessments of erythrocyte  S -adenosylmethionine (SAM) and  S -adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), plasma homocysteine (Hcy) and 6 organic micronutrients (retinol, 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, pyridoxal, thiamin, riboflavin, and vitamin E), and 1,129 plasma proteins were performed at 3 time points in each of 2\\u00a0years. Genetic makeup was analyzed with 1\\u00a0M SNP genotyping arrays, and nutrient status was assessed with 24-h dietary intake questionnaires. A pattern of metabolites (met_PC1) that included the ratio of erythrocyte SAM/SAH, Hcy, and 5 vitamins were identified by principal component analysis. Met_PC1 levels were significantly associated with (1) single-nucleotide polymorphisms, (2) levels of plasma proteins, and (3) multilocus genotypes coding for gastrointestinal and immune functions, as identified in a global network of metabolic/protein\\u2013protein interactions. Subsequent mining of data from curated pathway, network, and genome-wide association studies identified genetic and functional relationships that may be explained by gene\\u2013nutrient interactions. The systems nutrition strategy described here has thus associated a multivariate metabolite pattern in blood with genes involved in immune and gastrointestinal functions.

Volcanic tephra blanketed a substantial proportion of the island. By our estimations, approximately 23,000,000 m 3  of pyroclastic ashes and more coarse-grained particles were deposited unto La Palma's land surface in addition to the lava flow. Five months following the initial eruption, we measured the depth of the new ash layer across the island. We combined this data with drone-based observations to compile a dataset comprising the point distribution of ash depth. A spatial interpolation was then performed using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) to estimate the ash depth across the island at a 2 m spatial resolution. The interpolation performed well, yielding a root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 0.34 and thus, the dataset offers immense reuse potential for spatial inquiries related to evolutionary traits, vegetation patterns, and vegetation response to disturbance on oceanic islands. In addition, the data can be used to test different spatial interpolation techniques in an effort to improve the accuracy achieved using IDW.\",\"data_availability\":\"\",\"other_dataset_citations\":[\"{\\\"dataset_ids\\\": ['10.1038/s41597-022-01551-8'], context: \\\"High-resolution digital surface model of the 2021 eruption deposit of Cumbre Vieja volcano, La Palma, Spain|Sci.

Identifying sea-ice characteristics that serve as indicators of habitat quality will be crucial to the monitoring and management of climate change impacts. In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill is a key prey species and fishery target. Krill larvae depend upon sea-ice habitats to survive the winter and recruit to the population in spring. Existing observations of sea-ice characteristics lack sufficient spatiotemporal coverage to quantify which ones contribute to favourable overwintering habitat, leading to uncertainties in how current and future changes in sea ice affect krill populations. Here, we derive regional-scale indices of annual krill recruitment spanning 35 years across the southwest Atlantic. To develop meaningful indicators of sea-ice habitat, we selected variables from a high-resolution sea-ice model that are hypothesized as relevant for larval habitat use. The resulting correlations between recruitment and sea-ice indicators vary by region and show remote connections to sea ice that correspond with established theories of larval transport. Through an improved representation of sea-ice habitat quality, as compared with using more traditional satellite-derived variables such as sea-ice extent and duration, we highlight plausible regions of overwintering habitat. Our findings improve current understanding of how krill are likely responding to changing sea ice and support emerging views that larval habitat use is complex. Furthermore, regional variation in larval dependence on sea ice may provide pockets of resilience to change for the broader krill population.\",\"data_availability\":\"\",\"other_dataset_citations\":[]}"

Our approach uses a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network model as a feature extractor, which is then optimised specifically for crack detection. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we created and curated a dataset of 700 brickwork masonry fa\\u00e7ade images, and used 500 images for training, 100 for validation, and the remaining 100 images for testing. Results showed that our approach is very effective in detecting cracks, achieving an accuracy and F1-score of up to 100% when following end-to-end training of the neural network, thus being a promising solution for building inspection and maintenance, particularly in situations where annotated data is limited. Moreover, the transfer learning approach can be easily adapted to different types of masonry fa\\u00e7ades, making it a versatile tool for building inspection and maintenance.\",\"data_availability\":\"\",\"other_dataset_citations\":[\"{\\\"dataset_ids\\\": ['10.15142/T3TD19'], context: \\\"SDNET2018: A concrete crack image dataset for machine learning applications|10.15142/T3TD19\\\"}\",\"{\\\"dataset_ids\\\": ['10.5281/zenodo.8014150'], context: \\\"Brickwork cracks dataset|10.5281/zenodo.8014150\\\"}\",\"{\\\"dataset_ids\\\": ['10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848'], context: \\\"Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database|IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition|10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206848\\\"}\"]}"

         "{\"title\":\"Interactome Rewiring Following Pharmacological Targeting of BET Bromodomains\",\"abstract\":\"Summary Targeting bromodomains (BRDs) of the bromo-and-extra-terminal (BET) family offers opportunities for therapeutic intervention in cancer and other diseases. Here, we profile the interactomes of BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT following treatment with the pan-BET BRD inhibitor JQ1, revealing broad rewiring of the interaction landscape, with three distinct classes of behavior for the 603 unique interactors identified. A group of proteins associate in a JQ1-sensitive manner with BET BRDs through canonical and new binding modes, while two classes of extra-terminal (ET)-domain binding motifs mediate acetylation-independent interactions. Last, we identify an unexpected increase in several interactions following JQ1 treatment that define negative functions for BRD3 in the regulation of rRNA synthesis and potentially RNAPII-dependent gene expression that result in decreased cell proliferation. Together, our data highlight the contributions of BET protein modules to their interactomes allowing for a better understanding of pharmacological rewiring in response to JQ1.\",\"data_availability\":\"\",\"other_dataset_citations\":[]}"

         "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user provided an article with an ID and a text abstract, along with a list of potential dataset_ids and their context. The goal is to identify all citations of datasets, classify their type, and return the results in JSON.\n\nFirst, I need to look through the text of the paper to find any mentions of datasets. The text mentions three laboratories processing samples using different chemical protocols and measuring 14C. The DOI provided is \"https://doi.org/10.11588/data/10100\". \n\nNext, I need to check if this DOI matches the format for a dataset ID. The DOI format is 10.1... with a prefix of 10. So the example given in the problem has \"https://doi.org/10.11588/data/10100\". The DOI here starts with \"10.\" followed by a 4 or 5-digit number. The suffix part includes \"data\" and \"10100\". The problem mentions that the dataset_id is derived from the DOI. \n\nNow, looking at the potential_dataset_ids, the first one is the DOI. The context says that this is a dataset related to radiocarbon dating and cultural heritage. The other entries in the potential_dataset_ids are Accession IDs like \"EPI_ISL_10271777\" and \"IPR000264\", but those seem to be from different repositories. The user's text mentions that the three laboratories used 14C measurements. \n\nWait, the problem's text says that the three laboratories processed samples using different systems. The 14C measurements are part of the analysis. The DOI in the text is likely a dataset related to the radiocarbon dating. The other Accession IDs might be from other datasets, but the user's context includes the DOI as part of the dataset. \n\nSo, the dataset_id here is \"https://doi.org/10.11588/data/10100\". The type is \"Primary\" because it's a dataset used in the analysis, not just raw data. The other Accession IDs in the potential_dataset_ids are probably not relevant here. \n\nTherefore, the JSON should include this dataset_id and type as Primary. Since there's only one dataset found, the JSON array will have that object. The user's example response shows a similar structure, so I need to follow that format.\n</think>"

         "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The user provided an article with an ID and a text content. The potential_dataset_ids include a DOI and an Accession ID. First, I need to check if the DOI in the text is a dataset_id. The DOI given is https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FWCKSE. The format starts with 10. followed by a number, which matches the structure of a DOI. So that's a valid dataset_id. \n\nNext, the Accession ID mentioned is \"SAMN07159041\" and \"IPR000264\". The user's potential_dataset_ids list has one of these, but I need to check if they are present in the text. The text mentions \"data availability statement\" and \"Harvard Dataverse\" but doesn't directly mention the Accession ID. However, the example given in the potential_dataset_ids includes \"SAMN07159041\" as an Accession ID. Since the text does not explicitly state the Accession ID, but the example includes it, I should consider that as a possible dataset_id. But the user's potential_dataset_ids list has only one entry, so maybe the Accession ID is included there. However, the user's input might have a mistake in the potential_dataset_ids list. Let me double-check.\n\nThe user's potential_dataset_ids list shows ['https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FWCKSE', 'SAMN07159041'] as the dataset_ids. The context for the first one is \"Data availability statement\" and \"Harvard Dataverse\". The second one's context is not provided, but the user's example includes it. However, the user's actual input might have the Accession ID in the potential_dataset_ids. Since the user's text doesn't mention the Accession ID, but the example does, perhaps the correct dataset_id is the DOI. But the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes both. However, the user's actual input might have the Accession ID in the potential_dataset_ids list. Wait, looking back, the user's potential_dataset_ids list has 'SAMN07159041' as an Accession ID. The context for that is not provided, but the example given in the potential_dataset_ids includes it. So, perhaps the correct dataset_id is the Accession ID. But since the user's text doesn't mention it, maybe the correct answer is to include both? Wait, the user's potential_dataset_ids list has both entries. The first is a DOI, the second is an Accession ID. But the user's text mentions the DOI and the Accession ID in the context. However, the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes only one entry. Wait, no, the user's potential_dataset_ids list shows both entries. But maybe the Accession ID is not present in the text. Let me check again.\n\nThe text content mentions \"data availability statement\" and \"Harvard Dataverse\" but does not mention the Accession ID. However, the potential_dataset_ids list includes \"SAMN07159041\" as an Accession ID. So, even though the text doesn't mention it, the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes it. Therefore, I should process both entries. But the user's potential_dataset_ids list has both. So, in the JSON, both entries would be included, with their respective types. However, the user's potential_dataset_ids list has only one entry. Wait, no, looking back, the user's potential_dataset_ids list is:\n\npotential_dataset_ids: [{\"dataset_ids\": ['https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FWCKSE'], context: \"Data availability statement. Replication data for this article can be found in Harvard Dataverse at: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FWCKSE \"},]\n\nand the other entry is SAMN07159041. Wait, no, the user's potential_dataset_ids list is only one entry. Wait, the user's input shows the potential_dataset_ids as:\n\npotential_dataset_ids: [{\"dataset_ids\": ['https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FWCKSE'], context: \"Data availability statement. Replication data for this article can be found in Harvard Dataverse at: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FWCKSE \"},]\n\nand then maybe another entry? Wait, no, looking again, the user's potential_dataset_ids list is only the first entry. So, perhaps the Accession ID is not present in the text. Therefore, the only dataset_id found is the DOI. Therefore, the JSON should include that dataset_id and its type. However, the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes the Accession ID, but the text doesn't mention it. So, perhaps the correct answer is only the DOI. But the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes both entries. This is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the Accession ID is part of the dataset_ids provided, but the text doesn't mention it. Therefore, the correct answer is to process only the DOI. But since the user's potential_dataset_ids list includes both, perhaps I should check again. Let me confirm once more.\n\nThe user's potential_dataset_ids list is:\n\npotential_dataset_ids: [{\"dataset_ids\": ['https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/FWCKSE'], context: \"Data availability statement.

Wait, no, the user's input shows only the first entry. Therefore, only the DOI is present. So, the dataset_id is the DOI, and the type is \"Primary\" since it's a dataset for data availability. The Accession ID might not be present, so the JSON should include only that. Therefore, the final answer is a JSON with the dataset_id and type.\n</think>"
