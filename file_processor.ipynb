      "This manuscript describes a dataset of thoracic cavity segmentations and discrete pleural effusion segmentations we have annotated on 402 computed tomography (CT) scans acquired from patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The segmentation of these anatomic regions precedes fundamental tasks in image analysis pipelines such as lung structure segmentation, lesion detection, and radiomics feature extraction. Bilateral thoracic cavity volumes and pleural effusion volumes were manually segmented on CT scans acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive “NSCLC Radiomics” data collection. Four hundred and two thoracic segmentations were first generated automatically by a U-Net based algorithm trained on chest CTs without cancer, manually corrected by a medical student to include the complete thoracic cavity (normal, pathologic, and atelectatic lung parenchyma, lung hilum, pleural effusion, fibrosis, nodules, tumor, and other anatomic anomalies), and revised by a radiation oncologist or a radiologist. Seventy-eight pleural effusions were manually segmented by a medical student and revised by a radiologist or radiation oncologist. Interobserver agreement between the radiation oncologist and radiologist corrections was acceptable. All expert-vetted segmentations are publicly available in NIfTI format through The Cancer Imaging Archive at https://doi.org/10. 7937/tcia.2020.6c7y-gq39. Tabular data detailing clinical and technical metadata linked to segmentation cases are also available. Thoracic cavity segmentations will be valuable for developing image analysis pipelines on pathologic lungs — where current automated algorithms struggle most. In conjunction with gross tumor volume segmentations already available from “NSCLC Radiomics,” pleural effusion segmentations may be valuable for investigating radiomics profile differences between effusion and primary tumor or training algorithms to discriminate between them. © 2020 The Authors.

      "Automated or semi-automated algorithms aimed at analyzing chest computed tomography (CT) scans typically require the creation of a three-dimensional (3D) map of the volume-ofinterest (VOI) as the initial step.1,2 For example, a common first step for lung tumor detection on CT scans is lung segmentation.3 Effective strategies for identifying healthy lungs have existed at least since Hu et al. introduced a method for segmenting healthy lung parenchyma based on gray-level thresholding.4 Nevertheless, identifying the initial VOI in pathologic lungs remains an obstacle.5,6 Many pathologic states — such as pleural effusion, severe fibrosis, or tumor — can alter the space lung would normally occupy, and in this circumstance the VOI is not only the lung but the thoracic cavity. To build image processing pipelines intended to analyze chest CTs with substantively altered thoracic anatomy, identifying this VOI is critical. Preprocessing strategies to identify thoracic VOIs in the presence of pathology have been described. In 2014, Mansoor et al. presented a seminal approach that identified CTs with large volumetric differences between autosegmented lung and the thoracic cage and refined these lung segmentations using texture-based features.7 Subsequent studies have approached VOI identification in myriad ways, such as threshold-based methodologies,8 deep learning architectures,9–13 anatomic or shape-prior models,5,14–16 and region-growing methods.17,18 This is a block break.\n",
      "As methodologies to identify thoracic VOIs in pathologic lungs march forward, data to train and vet them must keep pace. Hofmanninger et al. cited a paucity of diverse data — not inferior methodologies — as the principal obstacle in pathologic lung segmentation.19 Echoing this point, Shaukat et al. observed that automated lung nodule detection system optimization is usually limited to just one dataset.20 Many datasets consist exclusively of diseases typified by mild to moderate anatomic change — for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or interstitial lung disease.10,11 However, disease processes commonly beset by lung consolidations, effusions, masses, and other opacities that dramatically alter the thoracic VOI are radiographically distinct. We present PleThora, a dataset of pleural effusion and left and right thoracic cavity segmentations delineated on 402 CT scans from The Cancer Imaging Archive21 (TCIA) NSCLC-Radiomics collection.22,23 Many of these cases have dramatic anatomic changes secondary to cancer. Thoracic segmentations include lung parenchyma, primary tumor, atelectasis, adhesions, effusion, and other anatomic variations when present. On scans where effusion is present, separate segmentations labeling pleural effusion alone are also provided. These may serve particular use for correlating effusion radiomics features with clinical data (available in the NSCLC-Radiomics spreadsheet, “Radiomics Lung1.clinicalversion3-Oct 2019.csv”) or studying how these features differ between effusion and primary tumor. Thoracic segmentations were generated automatically by a U-Net based deep learning algorithm trained on lungs without cancer, manually This is a block break.\n",

Pleural effusion segmentations were manually delineated by a medical student and revised by a radiologist. Expert gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentations already provided by the NSCLC-Radiomics collection informed our segmentations and made possible delineation of pleural effusion volumes that excluded GTV.

      "2.A. Segmentation acquisition This is a block break.\n",
      "Four hundred twenty-two Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) chest CT datasets and 318 corresponding “RTSTRUCT” DICOM segmentations (featuring GTVs) were downloaded from the TCIA NSCLC-Radiomics collection in January 2019. Four hundred and two CT scans were successfully converted from DICOM to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format using a free executable called “dcm2niix”.24,25 These 402 scans comprise the dataset upon which our thoracic cavity and pleural effusion segmentations were delineated. This is a block break.\n",
      "2.A.1. Thoracic cavity segmentation acquisition This is a block break.\n",
      "After converting each CT dataset to NIfTI format, lungs were automatically segmented by a publicly available 3D UNet lung segmentation algorithm26 that had been trained on a private dataset of approximately 200 chest CTs acquired from patients without cancer. Lung segmented reasonably well in subjects with minimal anatomic variation due to disease, but poorly in subjects with significant disease. A fourth-year medical student manually expanded each segmentation to include the thoracic cavity volume normally occupied by healthy lung. Among other anatomic anomalies, the expansion included normal, pathologic, and atelectatic lung parenchyma, pleural effusion, fibrosis, nodules, tumor, and compensatory anatomic variants such as enlarged collateral vessels. It also included major hilar vessels and bronchi that are not always segmented as part of the lung but are a frequent site of pathologic change. Importantly, effort was made to include all primary tumors in the segmentation even if this invaded the mediastinum or extended out of the thoracic cage. “RTSTRUCT” GTV segmentations from the NSCLCRadiomics collection assisted in this determination. Nodal disease in the mediastinum was not targeted. Each hemithorax, right and left, was segmented as a separate structure but saved under the same segmentation file. The medical student’s segmentations passed to at least one physician reviewer — either a radiologist or a radiation oncologist — to be vetted. As necessary, reviewers expanded or contracted the segmentations to include the target thoracic volumes. The most recent “RTSTRUCT” GTV segmentations (which were updated by the NSCLC-Radiomics dataset authors in October 2019) were available to reviewers for reference as necessary. The thoracic cavity segmentations we make public are vetted segmentations. The thoracic cavity This is a block break.\n",

Several additional computational tools transformed CT scans from DICOM to NIfTI format, autosegmented initial thoracic volumes, analyzed segmentations, and organized and visualized metadata.

These metrics are discussed in the following subsections, and lung segmentation interobserver variability reference values are given where possible. Although methodologies to automate CT pleural effusion segmentation39–42 or decrease qualitative size estimation variability43 have been described, we found only one limited report of pleural effusion segmentation interobserver variability39 against which we can compare our results (despite extensive PubMed searches).

      "The DSC measures interobserver agreement and ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no agreement and 1 indicates perfect agreement. In the context of image segmentation, the DSC relates the overlap between two segmentations to their total volumes; mathematically, this is twice the shared volume divided by the sum of their total volumes. No consensus dictates what constitutes a “good” DSC because the DSC is sensitive to the volume of the target structure. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 132 notes that the contouring uncertainty of a structure can be expected to be a DSC of 0.8–0.9, while cautioning that “very large or very small structures may have different expected DSC values for contour uncertainty.”44 For lung segmentation, DSC interobserver variability between three medical physicist organizers of the 2017 AAPM Thoracic Auto-Segmentation Challenge was reported as 0.956 \u0001 0.019 and 0.955 \u0001 0.019 for the left and right lungs, respectively.45 This is a block break.\n",

      "The Cohen’s kappa (κ) coefficient measures interobserver reliability for qualitative observations with mutually exclusive classifications. We computed κ between expert reviewer segmentations by treating each voxel as a qualitative datum. We transformed the segmentations to numerical arrays where each array value assumed one of two binary values depending on whether the reviewer included the voxel as part of the target structure. κ is similar to the DSC in its computation of interobserver agreement, but also assesses a likelihood of chance agreement and penalizes accordingly. Like the DSC, κ generally ranges between 0 and 1, although a result < 0 is possible. Results >0.6 are generally considered good and greater than 0.8 are considered very good,46 although like the DSC, κ inflates and deflates artificially depending on the target’s volume.

      "Recognizing the limitations of the traditional DSC with respect to volume, Nikolov et al.32 introduced a novel way to compute Dice’s coefficient called the surface DSC. As its name suggests, the sDSC’s inputs are segmentation surfaces rather than volumes. A primary advantage of the sDSC over the traditional DSC is increased robustness to segmentation size variation. The sDSC is not agnostic to size, but it inflates less dramatically with size than the volumetric DSC. The sDSC computation accepts a tolerance parameter whereby differences between two surfaces can be tolerated as the same surface. We set this parameter equal to zero in order to capture all differences between physician segmentations. Because the sDSC is novel, reference values for this metric are not yet widely reported. However, Vaassen et al.47 calculated the sDSC between automatically generated and radiotherapist-corrected lung segmentations and reported the majority of values to be greater than 0.85. Reasoning that inter-physician agreement ought to be at least as good as autosegmentation-radiotherapist agreement, we suggest 0.85 as an acceptable mean reference value for thoracic cavity segmentations.

Visual inspection reveals a large posterior density that RO1 classified as pleural effusion but Rad3 excluded as an atelectatic lung segment. In this case, Rad4’s segmentation arbitrates that the density is not effusion. The segmentation we made publicly available through TCIA in our first version of the dataset was only Rad4’s segmentation, but all reviewer segmentations were made available in the second version. Rad3 and Rad4’s pleural effusion segmentations for case LUNG1-253 suffered the highest 95HD value of any interobserver comparison. Here, 2D and 3D visual inspection reveals substantial disagreement respecting the superior-inferior and lateral extents of a thin layer of pleural fluid. We did not prospectively define guidelines for whether trace pleural fluid should or should not be segmented, which in hindsight we acknowledge is a limitation of our pleural effusion segmentation methodology. By contrast, the worst discrepancies between thoracic cavity segmentations are easily resolved by our segmentation guidelines. Thoracic cavity segmentations for LUNG1-026 suffered the worst sDSC interobserver variability, which can be attributed to the secondary physician reviewer’s erroneous neglect of the full extent of tumor, left hilum, and right pleural effusion. Similarly, the secondary reviewer erroneously excluded a left collapsed lung for case LUNG1-354, which was the thoracic cavity segmentation case with the worst DSC, κ, 95HD, and symmetric ASD.

      "To our knowledge, PleThora is the first public dataset of VOIs curated to capture all thoracic cavity pathologic change in patients with lung cancer, and the first public dataset of pleural effusion segmentations. The thoracic cavity segmentations are likely to be valuable to scientists and engineers who develop chest CT image processing pipelines that require robust methods to identify thoracic VOIs. We anticipate these segmentations to be a particularly useful addition to the corpus of training data for image processing pipelines, including the ones leveraging deep learning algorithms. Indeed, this project began as an effort to provide VOIs to study image feature symmetry between left and right thorax anatomy as a clinical outcomes predictor, building on previous work from our group that localized stroke cores by comparing and contrasting brain hemisphere information extracted by “symmetry-sensitive convolutional neural networks.”58 This is a block break.\n",
      "Our pleural effusion segmentations are likely to be useful for investigating two questions surrounding a CT or PET/CT finding of pleural effusion: (a) the prognostic significance of pleural effusion in various cancer types,59 and (b) the capacity of CT to discriminate between benign and malignant effusions.60–63 Regarding the first question, Ryu et al.59 showed that in small cell lung cancer with stage I–III disease, the presence of even minimal pleural effusion confers an increased risk of death. Investigating the prognostic relationship of pleural effusion presence in other cancer types would presumably be facilitated by deep learning pleural effusion segmentation algorithms, such as might be trained with datasets like ours. Regarding the second question, some CT findings (nodular, mediastinal, parietal, and circumferential pleural thickening) are classically considered to be reasonably specific but poorly sensitive discriminators of malignant effusion.64 Perhaps investigations into the value of pleural effusion quantitative imaging biomarkers for accomplishing this task could be fruitful. For example, Yang et al.65 reported that This is a block break.\n",
      "radiomics features extracted from lungs and pleura contained information capable of discriminating between patients with and without NSCLC dry pleural dissemination (AUC: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.891–0.968), which is a contraindication to primary tumor surgical resection that cannot always be detected by gross visualization. Our pleural effusion segmentations could enable other quantitative imaging biomarker studies. Importantly, our pleural effusion segmentations exclude primary tumor, as outlined in “RTSTRUCT” files, but users should not mistake this to mean that the effusions are necessarily benign. Microscopic tumor and macroscopic tumor below the threshold of radiologic detection are likely to exist in the effusions as delineated. It is also important to note that we failed to establish a guiding threshold for inclusion or exclusion of trace pleural fluid, an inconsistency that is reflected in several spatial similarity metrics we used to gauge interobserver variability. This stated, the effusion segmentations are still likely to be useful and may serve such research initiatives as correlating effusion parameters with clinical data available at the NSCLC-Radiomics “Radiomics Lung1.clinical-version3-Oct 2019.csv” spreadsheet or investigating differences in radiomics features between effusion and primary tumor. We acknowledge the limiting inconsistencies of humandelineated segmentations, even those from trained radiologists or radiation oncologists. We also acknowledge intrinsic limitations in the metrics themselves. The DSC and κ are both artificially increased in large volumes, and the power of κ to penalize chance agreement is artificially decreased by the high number of true negatives in our segmentations (i.e., the high number of voxels that neither reviewer segmented as part of the target). We attempted to buffer this limitation by calculating and comparing sDSC values, which are less sensitive to variation in size. The 95 HD and symmetric ASD are not inflated by volume but are only snapshots of segmentations at their average (ASD) and near their worst (95HD) differences. Notwithstanding these limitations, we consider that the measures of interobserver variability obtained between radiologist and radiation oncologist reviewers justify acceptability of these segmentations for public use.

cavity segmentations and discrete pleural effusion segmentations we have annotated on 402 computed tomography (CT) scans acquired from patients with non-small cell lung cancer.', 'The segmentation of these anatomic regions precedes fundamental tasks in image analysis pipelines such as lung structure segmentation, lesion detection, and radiomics feature extraction.', \"Bilateral thoracic cavity volumes and pleural effusion volumes were manually segmented on CT scans acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive 'NSCLC Radiomics' data collection.\", 'Four hundred and two thoracic segmentations were first generated automatically by a U-Net based algorithm trained on chest CTs without cancer, manually corrected by a medical student to include the complete thoracic cavity (normal, pathologic,

effusions were manually segmented by a medical student and revised by a radiologist or radiation oncologist.', 'Interobserver agreement between the radiation oncologist and radiologist corrections was acceptable.', 'All expert-vetted segmentations are publicly available in NIfTI format through The Cancer Imaging Archive at https://doi.org/10.', '7937/tcia.2020.6c7y-gq39.', 'Tabular data detailing

current automated algorithms struggle most.', \"In conjunction with gross tumor volume segmentations already available from 'NSCLC Radiomics,' pleural effusion segmentations may be valuable for investigating radiomics profile differences between effusion and primary tumor or training algorithms to discriminate between them.\", '© 2020 The Authors.', 'Medical Physics published by Wiley

techniques, image processing, informatics in imaging, quantitative imaging ', '1.', 'INTRODUCTION', '', 'Automated or semi-automated algorithms aimed at analyzing chest computed tomography (CT) scans typically require the creation of a three-dimensional (3D) map of the volume-ofinterest (VOI) as the initial step.1,2 For example, a common first step for lung tumor detection on CT scans is lung segmentation.3 Effective strategies for identifying healthy lungs have existed at least since Hu et al. introduced a method for segmenting healthy lung parenchyma based on gray-level thresholding.4 Nevertheless, identifying the initial VOI in pathologic lungs remains an obstacle.5,6', 'Many pathologic states - such as pleural effusion, severe fibrosis, or tumor - can alter the space lung would normally occupy, and in this circumstance the VOI is not only the lung but the thoracic cavity.', 'To build image processing pipelines intended to analyze chest CTs with substantively altered thoracic anatomy, identifying this VOI is critical.', 'Preprocessing strategies to identify thoracic VOIs in the presence of pathology have been described.', 'In 2014, Mansoor et al. presented a seminal approach that identified CTs with large volumetric differences between autosegmented lung and the thoracic cage and refined these lung segmentations using texture-based features.7 Subsequent studies have approached VOI identification in myriad ways, such as threshold-based methodologies,8 deep learning architectures,9-13 anatomic or shape-prior models,5,14-16 and region-growing methods.17,18', '', 'As methodologies to identify thoracic VOIs in pathologic lungs march forward, data to train and vet them must keep pace.', 'Hofmanninger et al. cited a paucity of diverse data - not inferior methodologies - as the principal obstacle in pathologic lung segmentation.19 Echoing this point, Shaukat et al. observed that automated lung nodule detection system optimization is usually limited to just one dataset.20', 'Many datasets consist exclusively of diseases typified by mild to moderate anatomic change - for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or interstitial lung disease.10,11', 'However, disease processes commonly beset by lung consolidations, effusions, masses, and other opacities that dramatically alter the thoracic VOI are radiographically distinct.', 'We present PleThora, a dataset of pleural effusion and left and right thoracic cavity segmentations delineated on 402 CT scans from The Cancer Imaging Archive21 (TCIA) NSCLC-Radiomics collection.22,23', 'Many of these cases have dramatic anatomic changes secondary to cancer.', 'Thoracic segmentations include lung parenchyma, primary tumor, atelectasis, adhesions, effusion, and other anatomic variations when present.', 'On scans where effusion is present, separate segmentations labeling pleural effusion alone are also provided.', \"These may serve particular use for correlating effusion radiomics features with clinical data (available in the NSCLC-Radiomics spreadsheet, 'Radiomics Lung1.clinicalversion3-Oct 2019.csv') or studying how these features differ between effusion and primary tumor.\", 'Thoracic segmentations were generated automatically by a U-Net based deep learning algorithm trained on lungs without cancer, manually', '', 'corrected by a medical student, and revised by a radiation oncologist or a radiologist.', 'Pleural effusion segmentations were manually delineated by a medical student and revised by a radiologist.', 'Expert gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentations already provided by the NSCLC-Radiomics collection informed our segmentations and made possible delineation of pleural effusion volumes that excluded GTV.', '', '2.', 'ACQUISITION AND VALIDATION METHODS ', '2.A.', 'Segmentation acquisition ', \"Four hundred twenty-two Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) chest CT datasets and 318 corresponding 'RTSTRUCT' DICOM segmentations (featuring GTVs) were downloaded from the TCIA NSCLC-Radiomics collection in January 2019.\", \"Four hundred and two CT scans were successfully converted from DICOM to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format using a free executable called 'dcm2niix'.24,25\", 'These 402 scans comprise the dataset upon which our thoracic cavity and pleural effusion segmentations were delineated.', '', '2.A.1.', 'Thoracic cavity segmentation acquisition', '', 'After converting each CT dataset to NIfTI format, lungs were automatically segmented by a publicly available 3D UNet lung segmentation algorithm26 that had been trained on a private dataset of approximately 200 chest CTs acquired from patients without cancer.', 'Lung segmented reasonably well in subjects with minimal anatomic variation due to disease, but poorly in subjects with significant disease.', 'A fourth-year medical student manually expanded each segmentation to include the thoracic cavity volume normally occupied by healthy lung.', 'Among other anatomic anomalies, the expansion included normal, pathologic, and atelectatic lung parenchyma, pleural effusion, fibrosis, nodules, tumor, and compensatory anatomic variants such as enlarged collateral vessels.', 'It also included major hilar vessels and bronchi that are not always segmented as part of the lung but are a frequent site of pathologic change.', 'Importantly, effort was made to include all primary tumors in the segmentation even if this invaded the mediastinum or extended out of the thoracic cage.', \"'RTSTRUCT' GTV segmentations from the NSCLCRadiomics collection assisted in this determination.\", 'Nodal disease in the mediastinum was not targeted.', 'Each hemithorax, right and left, was segmented as a separate structure but saved under the same segmentation file.', \"The medical student's segmentations passed to at least one physician reviewer - either a radiologist or a radiation oncologist - to be vetted.\", 'As necessary, reviewers expanded or contracted the segmentations to include the target thoracic volumes.', \"The most recent 'RTSTRUCT' GTV segmentations (which were updated by the NSCLC-Radiomics

      "This manuscript describes a dataset of thoracic cavity segmentations and discrete pleural effusion segmentations we have annotated on 402 computed tomography (CT) scans acquired from patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The segmentation of these anatomic regions precedes fundamental tasks in image analysis pipelines such as lung structure segmentation, lesion detection, and radiomics feature extraction. Bilateral thoracic cavity volumes and pleural effusion volumes were manually segmented on CT scans acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive “NSCLC Radiomics” data collection. Four hundred and two thoracic segmentations were first generated automatically by a U-Net based algorithm trained on chest CTs without cancer, manually corrected by a medical student to include the complete thoracic cavity (normal, pathologic, and atelectatic lung parenchyma, lung hilum, pleural effusion, fibrosis, nodules, tumor, and other anatomic anomalies), and revised by a radiation oncologist or a radiologist. Seventy-eight pleural effusions were manually segmented by a medical student and revised by a radiologist or radiation oncologist. Interobserver agreement between the radiation oncologist and radiologist corrections was acceptable. All expert-vetted segmentations are publicly available in NIfTI format through The Cancer Imaging Archive at https://doi.org/10. 7937/tcia.2020.6c7y-gq39. Tabular data detailing clinical and technical metadata linked to segmentation cases are also available. Thoracic cavity segmentations will be valuable for developing image analysis pipelines on pathologic lungs — where current automated algorithms struggle most. In conjunction with gross tumor volume segmentations already available from “NSCLC Radiomics,” pleural effusion segmentations may be valuable for investigating radiomics profile differences between effusion and primary tumor or training algorithms to discriminate between them. © 2020 The Authors.

      "Automated or semi-automated algorithms aimed at analyzing chest computed tomography (CT) scans typically require the creation of a three-dimensional (3D) map of the volume-ofinterest (VOI) as the initial step.1,2 For example, a common first step for lung tumor detection on CT scans is lung segmentation.3 Effective strategies for identifying healthy lungs have existed at least since Hu et al. introduced a method for segmenting healthy lung parenchyma based on gray-level thresholding.4 Nevertheless, identifying the initial VOI in pathologic lungs remains an obstacle.5,6 Many pathologic states — such as pleural effusion, severe fibrosis, or tumor — can alter the space lung would normally occupy, and in this circumstance the VOI is not only the lung but the thoracic cavity. To build image processing pipelines intended to analyze chest CTs with substantively altered thoracic anatomy, identifying this VOI is critical. Preprocessing strategies to identify thoracic VOIs in the presence of pathology have been described. In 2014, Mansoor et al. presented a seminal approach that identified CTs with large volumetric differences between autosegmented lung and the thoracic cage and refined these lung segmentations using texture-based features.7 Subsequent studies have approached VOI identification in myriad ways, such as threshold-based methodologies,8 deep learning architectures,9–13 anatomic or shape-prior models,5,14–16 and region-growing methods.17,18 This is a block break.\n",
      "As methodologies to identify thoracic VOIs in pathologic lungs march forward, data to train and vet them must keep pace. Hofmanninger et al. cited a paucity of diverse data — not inferior methodologies — as the principal obstacle in pathologic lung segmentation.19 Echoing this point, Shaukat et al. observed that automated lung nodule detection system optimization is usually limited to just one dataset.20 Many datasets consist exclusively of diseases typified by mild to moderate anatomic change — for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or interstitial lung disease.10,11 However, disease processes commonly beset by lung consolidations, effusions, masses, and other opacities that dramatically alter the thoracic VOI are radiographically distinct. We present PleThora, a dataset of pleural effusion and left and right thoracic cavity segmentations delineated on 402 CT scans from The Cancer Imaging Archive21 (TCIA) NSCLC-Radiomics collection.22,23 Many of these cases have dramatic anatomic changes secondary to cancer. Thoracic segmentations include lung parenchyma, primary tumor, atelectasis, adhesions, effusion, and other anatomic variations when present. On scans where effusion is present, separate segmentations labeling pleural effusion alone are also provided. These may serve particular use for correlating effusion radiomics features with clinical data (available in the NSCLC-Radiomics spreadsheet, “Radiomics Lung1.clinicalversion3-Oct 2019.csv”) or studying how these features differ between effusion and primary tumor. Thoracic segmentations were generated automatically by a U-Net based deep learning algorithm trained on lungs without cancer, manually This is a block break.\n",

Pleural effusion segmentations were manually delineated by a medical student and revised by a radiologist. Expert gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentations already provided by the NSCLC-Radiomics collection informed our segmentations and made possible delineation of pleural effusion volumes that excluded GTV.

      "2.A. Segmentation acquisition This is a block break.\n",
      "Four hundred twenty-two Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) chest CT datasets and 318 corresponding “RTSTRUCT” DICOM segmentations (featuring GTVs) were downloaded from the TCIA NSCLC-Radiomics collection in January 2019. Four hundred and two CT scans were successfully converted from DICOM to Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) format using a free executable called “dcm2niix”.24,25 These 402 scans comprise the dataset upon which our thoracic cavity and pleural effusion segmentations were delineated. This is a block break.\n",
      "2.A.1. Thoracic cavity segmentation acquisition This is a block break.\n",
      "After converting each CT dataset to NIfTI format, lungs were automatically segmented by a publicly available 3D UNet lung segmentation algorithm26 that had been trained on a private dataset of approximately 200 chest CTs acquired from patients without cancer. Lung segmented reasonably well in subjects with minimal anatomic variation due to disease, but poorly in subjects with significant disease. A fourth-year medical student manually expanded each segmentation to include the thoracic cavity volume normally occupied by healthy lung. Among other anatomic anomalies, the expansion included normal, pathologic, and atelectatic lung parenchyma, pleural effusion, fibrosis, nodules, tumor, and compensatory anatomic variants such as enlarged collateral vessels. It also included major hilar vessels and bronchi that are not always segmented as part of the lung but are a frequent site of pathologic change. Importantly, effort was made to include all primary tumors in the segmentation even if this invaded the mediastinum or extended out of the thoracic cage. “RTSTRUCT” GTV segmentations from the NSCLCRadiomics collection assisted in this determination. Nodal disease in the mediastinum was not targeted. Each hemithorax, right and left, was segmented as a separate structure but saved under the same segmentation file. The medical student’s segmentations passed to at least one physician reviewer — either a radiologist or a radiation oncologist — to be vetted. As necessary, reviewers expanded or contracted the segmentations to include the target thoracic volumes. The most recent “RTSTRUCT” GTV segmentations (which were updated by the NSCLC-Radiomics dataset authors in October 2019) were available to reviewers for reference as necessary. The thoracic cavity segmentations we make public are vetted segmentations. The thoracic cavity This is a block break.\n",

      "To assess the quality of segmentations with respect to interobserver variability, volumetric (i.e., traditional) Dice similarity coefficients36 (DSC), Cohen’s kappa coefficients,37 surface Dice similarity coefficients32 (sDSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff distances38 (95HD), and symmetric average surface distances (ASD) were computed between expert reviewer segmentations. These metrics are discussed in the following subsections, and lung segmentation interobserver variability reference values are given where possible. Although methodologies to automate CT pleural effusion segmentation39–42 or decrease qualitative size estimation variability43 have been described, we found only one limited report of pleural effusion segmentation interobserver variability39 against which we can compare our results (despite extensive PubMed searches). This is a block break.\n",
      "2.C.1. Volumetric Dice similarity coefﬁcient This is a block break.\n",
      "The DSC measures interobserver agreement and ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no agreement and 1 indicates perfect agreement. In the context of image segmentation, the DSC relates the overlap between two segmentations to their total volumes; mathematically, this is twice the shared volume divided by the sum of their total volumes. No consensus dictates what constitutes a “good” DSC because the DSC is sensitive to the volume of the target structure. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 132 notes that the contouring uncertainty of a structure can be expected to be a DSC of 0.8–0.9, while cautioning that “very large or very small structures may have different expected DSC values for contour uncertainty.”44 For lung segmentation, DSC interobserver variability between three medical physicist organizers of the 2017 AAPM Thoracic Auto-Segmentation Challenge was reported as 0.956 \u0001 0.019 and 0.955 \u0001 0.019 for the left and right lungs, respectively.45 This is a block break.\n",
      "For pleural effusion segmentation, Yao et al.39 reported mean DSC observer variability between a research fellow, the same This is a block break.\n",
      "fellow months later, and an image processing technologist to be about 0.73. Comparisons against this reference value should be made cautiously because it was calculated for only 12 CT scans with unspecified pleural effusion volumes. This is a block break.\n",
      "2.C.2. Cohen’s Kappa coefﬁcient This is a block break.\n",
      "The Cohen’s kappa (κ) coefficient measures interobserver reliability for qualitative observations with mutually exclusive classifications. We computed κ between expert reviewer segmentations by treating each voxel as a qualitative datum. We transformed the segmentations to numerical arrays where each array value assumed one of two binary values depending on whether the reviewer included the voxel as part of the target structure. κ is similar to the DSC in its computation of interobserver agreement, but also assesses a likelihood of chance agreement and penalizes accordingly. Like the DSC, κ generally ranges between 0 and 1, although a result < 0 is possible. Results >0.6 are generally considered good and greater than 0.8 are considered very good,46 although like the DSC, κ inflates and deflates artificially depending on the target’s volume. This is a block break.\n",
      "2.C.3. Surface Dice similarity coefﬁcient This is a block break.\n",
      "Recognizing the limitations of the traditional DSC with respect to volume, Nikolov et al.32 introduced a novel way to compute Dice’s coefficient called the surface DSC. As its name suggests, the sDSC’s inputs are segmentation surfaces rather than volumes. A primary advantage of the sDSC over the traditional DSC is increased robustness to segmentation size variation. The sDSC is not agnostic to size, but it inflates less dramatically with size than the volumetric DSC. The sDSC computation accepts a tolerance parameter whereby differences between two surfaces can be tolerated as the same surface. We set this parameter equal to zero in order to capture all differences between physician segmentations. Because the sDSC is novel, reference values for this metric are not yet widely reported. However, Vaassen et al.47 calculated the sDSC between automatically generated and radiotherapist-corrected lung segmentations and reported the majority of values to be greater than 0.85. Reasoning that inter-physician agreement ought to be at least as good as autosegmentation-radiotherapist agreement, we suggest 0.85 as an acceptable mean reference value for thoracic cavity segmentations.

We did not prospectively define guidelines for whether trace pleural fluid should or should not be segmented, which in hindsight we acknowledge is a limitation of our pleural effusion segmentation methodology. By contrast, the worst discrepancies between thoracic cavity segmentations are easily resolved by our segmentation guidelines. Thoracic cavity segmentations for LUNG1-026 suffered the worst sDSC interobserver variability, which can be attributed to the secondary physician reviewer’s erroneous neglect of the full extent of tumor, left hilum, and right pleural effusion. Similarly, the secondary reviewer erroneously excluded a left collapsed lung for case LUNG1-354, which was the thoracic cavity segmentation case with the worst DSC, κ, 95HD, and symmetric ASD. The thoracic cavity segmentations we made publicly available for these cases in the first version of the dataset were the primary reviewer’s segmentations, but all reviewers’ segmentations were made available in the second version (after correcting the aforementioned errors).

Pleural effusion segmentations are likewise saved in a compressed NIfTI format and named for their respective case and reviewer (e.g., “LUNG1-001_effusion_first_reviewer.nii.gz”). Many thoracic cavity and all pleural effusion segmentations were reviewed by two or more experts. In this dataset’s original TCIA publication, only primary reviewer segmentations were made available. However, all reviewers’ segmentations — primary, secondary, and tertiary — were made available in a recent dataset update (version 2). A spreadsheet entitled “Thorax and Pleural Effusion Segmentation Metadata” contains clinical and technical metadata pertaining to each segmentation or CT scan. It is hosted in the same repository as the segmentations. We strongly recommend users merge it with the NSCLC-Radiomics spreadsheet “Radiomics Lung1.clinical-version3-Oct 2019.csv,” which provides ten columns of clinical data tied to each case.

      "CT scans were preprocessed as follows: voxel intensities were clipped to a range of [−250, 0] Hounsfield units by reassigning voxels less than −250 to −250 and greater than 0 to 0, voxels were isotropically resampled to 1.7 mm in each dimension, and scans were cropped from the image center to 256 by 256 by 128 voxels. Segmentations were likewise resampled and cropped. The models were trained using 316 of the 402 primary reviewer segmentations and tested with 86 secondary reviewer segmentations. The latter served as a test dataset because secondary and primary reviews were conducted independently. Nevertheless, because secondary and primary reviewers corrected the same template segmentation, we felt that corrected segmentations were likely to inherit similarities from the template that would bias the test dataset toward the training dataset. Therefore, we chose to exclude the 86 primary reviewer segmentations that corresponded to cases with a secondary reviewer from the training data. The model was initially trained end-to-end by fivefold cross validation. This permitted fine-tuning of the hyperparameters (e.g., epochs, learning rate, batch size) without overfitting the external training set. The whole dataset split and secondary reviewer segmentations were recently made available through TCIA in an update (version 2) of the original dataset. This is a block break.\n",

      "4. DISCUSSION This is a block break.\n",
      "To our knowledge, PleThora is the first public dataset of VOIs curated to capture all thoracic cavity pathologic change in patients with lung cancer, and the first public dataset of pleural effusion segmentations. The thoracic cavity segmentations are likely to be valuable to scientists and engineers who develop chest CT image processing pipelines that require robust methods to identify thoracic VOIs. We anticipate these segmentations to be a particularly useful addition to the corpus of training data for image processing pipelines, including the ones leveraging deep learning algorithms. Indeed, this project began as an effort to provide VOIs to study image feature symmetry between left and right thorax anatomy as a clinical outcomes predictor, building on previous work from our group that localized stroke cores by comparing and contrasting brain hemisphere information extracted by “symmetry-sensitive convolutional neural networks.”58 This is a block break.\n",
      "Our pleural effusion segmentations are likely to be useful for investigating two questions surrounding a CT or PET/CT finding of pleural effusion: (a) the prognostic significance of pleural effusion in various cancer types,59 and (b) the capacity of CT to discriminate between benign and malignant effusions.60–63 Regarding the first question, Ryu et al.59 showed that in small cell lung cancer with stage I–III disease, the presence of even minimal pleural effusion confers an increased risk of death. Investigating the prognostic relationship of pleural effusion presence in other cancer types would presumably be facilitated by deep learning pleural effusion segmentation algorithms, such as might be trained with datasets like ours. Regarding the second question, some CT findings (nodular, mediastinal, parietal, and circumferential pleural thickening) are classically considered to be reasonably specific but poorly sensitive discriminators of malignant effusion.64 Perhaps investigations into the value of pleural effusion quantitative imaging biomarkers for accomplishing this task could be fruitful. For example, Yang et al.65 reported that This is a block break.\n",
      "radiomics features extracted from lungs and pleura contained information capable of discriminating between patients with and without NSCLC dry pleural dissemination (AUC: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.891–0.968), which is a contraindication to primary tumor surgical resection that cannot always be detected by gross visualization. Our pleural effusion segmentations could enable other quantitative imaging biomarker studies. Importantly, our pleural effusion segmentations exclude primary tumor, as outlined in “RTSTRUCT” files, but users should not mistake this to mean that the effusions are necessarily benign. Microscopic tumor and macroscopic tumor below the threshold of radiologic detection are likely to exist in the effusions as delineated. It is also important to note that we failed to establish a guiding threshold for inclusion or exclusion of trace pleural fluid, an inconsistency that is reflected in several spatial similarity metrics we used to gauge interobserver variability. This stated, the effusion segmentations are still likely to be useful and may serve such research initiatives as correlating effusion parameters with clinical data available at the NSCLC-Radiomics “Radiomics Lung1.clinical-version3-Oct 2019.csv” spreadsheet or investigating differences in radiomics features between effusion and primary tumor. We acknowledge the limiting inconsistencies of humandelineated segmentations, even those from trained radiologists or radiation oncologists. We also acknowledge intrinsic limitations in the metrics themselves. The DSC and κ are both artificially increased in large volumes, and the power of κ to penalize chance agreement is artificially decreased by the high number of true negatives in our segmentations (i.e., the high number of voxels that neither reviewer segmented as part of the target). We attempted to buffer this limitation by calculating and comparing sDSC values, which are less sensitive to variation in size. The 95 HD and symmetric ASD are not inflated by volume but are only snapshots of segmentations at their average (ASD) and near their worst (95HD) differences. Notwithstanding these limitations, we consider that the measures of interobserver variability obtained between radiologist and radiation oncologist reviewers justify acceptability of these segmentations for public use.

typically require the creation of a three-dimensional (3D) map of the volume-ofinterest (VOI) as the initial step.1,2 For example, a common first step for lung tumor detection on CT scans is lung segmentation.3 Effective strategies for identifying healthy lungs have existed at least since Hu et al. introduced a method for segmenting healthy lung parenchyma based on gray-level thresholding.4 Nevertheless, identifying the initial VOI in pathologic lungs remains an obstacle.5,6', 'Many pathologic states - such as pleural effusion, severe fibrosis, or tumor - can alter the space lung would normally occupy, and in this circumstance the VOI is not only the lung but the thoracic cavity.', 'To build image processing pipelines intended to analyze chest CTs with substantively altered thoracic anatomy, identifying this VOI is critical.', 'Preprocessing strategies to identify thoracic VOIs in the presence of pathology have been described.', 'In 2014, Mansoor et al. presented a seminal approach that identified CTs with large volumetric differences between autosegmented lung and the thoracic cage and refined these lung segmentations using texture-based features.7 Subsequent studies have approached VOI identification in myriad ways, such as threshold-based methodologies,8 deep learning architectures,9-13 anatomic or shape-prior models,5,14-16 and region-growing methods.17,18', '', 'As methodologies to identify thoracic VOIs in pathologic lungs march forward, data to train and vet them must keep pace.', 'Hofmanninger et al. cited a paucity of diverse data - not inferior methodologies - as the principal obstacle in pathologic lung segmentation.19 Echoing this point, Shaukat et al. observed that automated lung nodule detection system optimization is usually limited to just one dataset.20', 'Many datasets consist exclusively of diseases typified by mild to moderate anatomic change - for example, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or interstitial lung disease.10,11', 'However, disease processes commonly beset by lung consolidations, effusions, masses, and other opacities that dramatically alter the thoracic VOI are radiographically distinct.', 'We present PleThora, a dataset of pleural effusion and left and right thoracic cavity segmentations delineated on 402 CT scans from The Cancer Imaging Archive21 (TCIA) NSCLC-Radiomics collection.22,23', 'Many of these cases have dramatic anatomic changes secondary to cancer.', 'Thoracic segmentations include lung parenchyma, primary tumor, atelectasis, adhesions, effusion, and other anatomic variations when present.', 'On scans where effusion is present, separate segmentations labeling pleural effusion alone are also provided.', \"These may serve particular use for correlating effusion radiomics features with clinical data (available in the NSCLC-Radiomics spreadsheet, 'Radiomics Lung1.clinicalversion3-Oct 2019.csv') or studying how these features differ between effusion and primary tumor.\", 'Thoracic segmentations were generated automatically by a U-Net based deep learning algorithm trained on lungs without cancer, manually', '', 'corrected by a medical student, and revised by a radiation oncologist or a radiologist.', 'Pleural effusion segmentations were manually delineated by a medical student and revised by a radiologist.', 'Expert gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentations

delineated.', '', '2.A.1.', 'Thoracic cavity segmentation acquisition', '', 'After converting each CT dataset to NIfTI format, lungs were automatically segmented by a publicly available 3D UNet lung segmentation algorithm26 that had been trained on a private dataset of approximately 200 chest CTs acquired from patients without cancer.', 'Lung segmented reasonably well in subjects with minimal anatomic variation due to disease, but poorly in subjects with significant disease.', 'A fourth-year medical student manually expanded each segmentation to include the thoracic cavity volume normally occupied by healthy lung.', 'Among other anatomic anomalies, the expansion included normal, pathologic, and atelectatic lung parenchyma, pleural effusion, fibrosis, nodules, tumor, and compensatory anatomic variants such as enlarged collateral vessels.', 'It also included major hilar vessels and bronchi that are not always segmented as part of the lung but are a frequent site of pathologic change.', 'Importantly, effort was made to include all primary tumors in the segmentation even if this invaded the mediastinum or extended out of the thoracic cage.', \"'RTSTRUCT' GTV segmentations from the NSCLCRadiomics collection assisted in this determination.\", 'Nodal disease in the mediastinum was not targeted.', 'Each hemithorax, right and left, was segmented as a separate structure but
