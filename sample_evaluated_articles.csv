Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON structure with a paper section and wants me to extract dataset IDs and classify them as Primary or Secondary. 

First, I need to check the data_availability section. The input says it's empty, so I should look at the other_dataset_citations. There are three entries. 

Looking at each dataset_id, I need to validate them. The first one is ""10.17882/49388"". The citation context mentions a global database for vertical profiles from Biogeochemical Argo. Since the data_availability is empty, and the citations are there, this seems like a valid dataset. The DOI is valid and refers to a dataset. So this should be Primary.

Next, the second dataset_id is ""10.17882/47142"". The citation context also mentions a global bio-optical database. Again, the data_availability is empty, so this is a valid dataset. Primary.

Third, ""10.5194/essd-2017-58"" has a citation context about two databases derived from BGC-Argo. Since the data_availability is empty, this is also a valid dataset. Primary.

Now, I need to check if there are any Secondary indicators. The citation contexts mention ""global database"" and ""global bio-optical database"", which are likely Secondary. The data_availability is empty, so no Secondary data here. 

So all three dataset_ids are Primary. The output should be a JSON array with each dataset as an object. The user's example shows that if there are multiple, they list them. Since there are three, the JSON array should include all three. 

I need to make sure not to include any other data. The data_availability is empty, so no more entries. Also, check for any possible duplicates, but since each is unique, no need to deduplicate. 

Finally, format the JSON correctly. The structure should have the dataset_ids and their types. All three are Primary, so the output is as specified.

It is shown that O 2 immediately dissociates upon first contact with the Mg anode (modeled as Mg(0001), Mg(10 1 \u203e 0)A, and Mg(10 1 \u203e 1)), heating the surface to several 1000 K.

Our data confirm that >45% of females had attached spermatophores arising from at least two males (i.e., confirming polyandry), but we found very limited evidence for multiple paternity; among 24 clutches sampled in this study, only two arose from fertilizations by two or more males.

It is clear that discrete classification of these species as either having genetic ( GSD ) or environmental sex determination ( ESD ) does not agree with empirical data. Although many species in this group show temperature-dependent sex determination ( TSD ), recent evidence suggests additional genetic or epigenetic effects. A proposed model explaining the adaptive significance and evolution of TSD in short-lived agamids predicts that selection will favor temperature-biased sex ratios in species with intense male-male competition. Here, we use experimental incubation at (near) constant temperatures to test whether the sex of Australian painted dragons ( Ctenophorus pictus ) is influenced by temperature, building on previous research yet to have reached an agreement regarding the role of temperature in this species. In this study, incubation temperature and parental identity affected hatchling sex suggesting that environment and genetics may work in concert to determine sex in this species. Although our results are consistent with TSD , our data cannot rule out a temperature-by-sex effect on egg or hatchling mortality. However, our findings together with the observed differences of sex determination systems in closely related species within this genus may provide novel opportunities to address fundamental questions in the evolution of sex determination systems."",""data_availability"":"""",""other_dataset_citations"":[]}

Despite the success of UCEs, it is becoming increasing apparent that diverse lineages require probe sets tailored to focal taxa in order to improve locus recovery. However, factors affecting probe design and methods for optimizing probe sets to focal taxa remain underexplored. Here, we use newly available beetle (Coleoptera) genomic resources to investigate factors affecting UCE probe set design using phyluce . In particular, we explore the effects of stringency during initial design steps, as well as base genome choice on resulting probe sets and locus recovery. We found that both base genome choice and initial bait design stringency parameters greatly alter the number of resultant probes included in final probe sets and strongly affect the number of loci detected and recovered during in silico testing of these probe sets. In addition, we identify attributes of base genomes that correlated with high performance in probe design. Ultimately, we provide a recommended workflow for using phyluce to design an optimized UCE probe set that will work across a targeted lineage, and use our findings to develop a new, open-source UCE probe set for beetles of the suborder Adephaga."",""data_availability"":""DATA AVAILABILITY DNA sequences: GenBank MK838494 to MK838511;  phyluce  BED/BAM files for probe design experiments and Adephaga_2.9Kv1 final probe set fasta file: Dryad  https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.2f62927 ; Custom scripts: Alexander 2018a: Comparing_monolithic_UCE_fastas available from;  https://github.com/laninsky/comparing_monolithic_UCE_fastas ; Alexander 2018b: Phase_target available from  https://github.com/laninsky/reference_aligning_to_established_loci/tree/master/phase_target ; Alexander 2018c: distance_calcs available from:  https://github.com/laninsky/distance_calcs ; Alexander 2018d: Phase_everyone available from  https://github.com/laninsky/reference_aligning_to_established_loci/tree/master/phase_everyone ."",""other_dataset_citations"":[]}

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON string representing a paper section and wants me to extract dataset IDs and classify them as Primary or Secondary. 

First, I need to check the data_availability and other_dataset_citations sections. The data_availability has entries like DNA sequences and files. The key here is to look for DOI or Accession IDs. 

Looking at the data_availability, there's a mention of ""phyluce BED/BAM files for probe design experiments and Adephaga_2.9Kv1 final probe set fasta file: Dryad"". The Dryad DOI is 10.5061/dryad.2f62927. That looks like a DOI. Then there's a link to a GitHub repository for scripts, which might be a URL, not a DOI. 

Next, the other_dataset_citations section is empty. So, only the Dryad DOI is valid. Now, I need to check if this is a dataset. The Dryad DOI is a dataset identifier, so it's a DOI. 

Now, applying the classification logic. The abstract mentions using phyluce for UCE probe design, which is a software. The data_availability includes a Dryad DOI, which is a dataset. The citation context doesn't mention people, so it's Secondary. 

Wait, but the classification depends on whether the data was originally generated by the authors. The authors are Gustafson Grey T. The Dryad DOI is for a dataset, so if the data was generated by the authors, it's Primary. But the abstract says ""we use newly available beetle genomic resources..."" which suggests that the data was acquired from external sources. 

So, the data_availability has a Dryad DOI, which is a dataset. The citation context doesn't mention people, so it's Secondary. Therefore, the dataset_id is Primary. 

But wait, the classification depends on the origin. If the data was generated by the authors, it's Primary. If it's from an external source, Secondary. The abstract mentions using beetle genomic resources, which might imply that the data was acquired from an external source. 

So, the dataset_id is Primary. The Dryad DOI is a valid dataset ID. The other_dataset_citations is empty, so no more citations. 

Therefore, the final answer should include the Dryad DOI as a Primary dataset.

At the individual level, variations in migratory behavior may lead to differences in fitness and subsequently influence the population's demographic dynamics. Using lifetime GPS bio-logging data from 169 white storks ( Ciconia ciconia ), we explore whether the recently shortened migration distance of storks affects their survival during different stages of their juvenile life. We also explore how other variations in migratory decisions (i.e., time, destination), movement activity (measured using overall body dynamic acceleration), and early life conditions influence juvenile survival. We observed that their first autumn migration was the riskiest period for juvenile white storks. Individuals that migrated shorter distances and fledged earlier experienced lower mortality risks. In addition, higher movement activity and overwintering 'closer-to-home' (with 84.21% of the tracked individuals stayed Europe or North Africa) were associated with higher survival.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON string representing a paper section, and I need to extract dataset IDs and classify them as Primary or Secondary. Let me start by reading through the input carefully.

First, the title is ""Closer to home strategy benefits juvenile survival in a long-distance migratory bird"". The author is Cheng Yachang. The abstract mentions data from 169 white storks using GPS data. The data_availability section lists several DOIs. The other_dataset_citations is empty.

Looking at the data_availability, there are five DOIs listed. Each has a DOI format. The important rule is to check if the DOI is a dataset_id. The DOI starts with ""10."" and has a 4 or 5-digit number. The examples given in the key definitions include DOIs like 10.12345/12345. The user's task is to extract only valid dataset IDs. So, I need to check each DOI to see if it's a dataset_id. The DOI format is correct, so all these DOIs are valid dataset IDs.

Next, the other_dataset_citations is an empty list, so no citations to consider. Now, I need to classify each dataset_id as Primary or Secondary. The classification depends on the abstract and citation context. The abstract mentions that the data was used for this study, and the citations are empty. The keywords in the abstract include ""survival"", ""migratory"", ""data release"", etc. 

For each dataset_id, I need to check if the specific data product (like the stork data) was generated by the authors of this paper. The abstract doesn't mention any specific data product being generated by the authors, but it does state that the data was used. Since the data_availability section includes the DOIs, and the other_citations are empty, the data is from the study. 

Now, applying the classification logic. The abstract doesn't explicitly state if the data was generated by the authors, but the data_availability includes the DOI. The DOI is a valid dataset_id. The classification as Primary or Secondary depends on whether the data was generated by the authors. Since the abstract doesn't mention the authors directly, but the data_availability includes the DOI, which is a dataset_id, I need to check if the DOI refers to a dataset. The DOI format is correct, so all these DOIs are valid dataset IDs. 

Since the data_availability includes the DOIs, and the other_citations are empty, the data is from the study. The classification as Primary or Secondary would depend on whether the data was generated by the authors. The abstract doesn't explicitly state that, but the data_availability includes the DOI. 

Wait, the key point is to check if the specific data product (the stork data) was generated by the authors. The abstract mentions that the data was used for this study, but not the authors. However, the data_availability includes the DOI, which is a dataset_id. The classification as Primary or Secondary would be based on whether the data was generated by the authors. Since the abstract doesn't mention the authors, but the data_availability includes the DOI, which is a dataset_id, I need to check if the DOI refers to a dataset. 

In this case, all the DOIs listed are valid dataset IDs. The classification as Primary or Secondary would depend on whether the data was generated by the authors. Since the abstract doesn't mention the authors, but the data_availability includes the DOI, which is a dataset_id, I need to check if the DOI refers to a dataset. 

The answer here is that all the DOIs are valid dataset IDs. Since the data_availability includes the DOIs, and the other_citations are empty, the data is from the study. The classification as Primary or Secondary would be based on whether the data was generated by the authors. Since the abstract doesn't mention the authors, but the data_availability includes the DOI, which is a dataset_id, I need to check if the DOI refers to a dataset. 

In this case, all the DOIs are valid dataset IDs. Therefore, the classification for each dataset_id would be Primary, as they are directly related to the study's findings. However, the abstract doesn't explicitly state that the data was generated by the authors, but the data_availability includes the DOI, which is a dataset_id. 

Wait, the classification logic says that if the data is from the authors, it's Primary. If from external sources, Secondary. Since the data_availability includes the DOI, which is a dataset_id, and the other_citations are empty, the data is from the study. Therefore, the classification is Primary. 

So, the final answer would include all the valid dataset IDs as Primary. The other_dataset_citations are empty, so no need to process them. The data_availability includes the DOIs, which are valid dataset IDs. Therefore, the JSON array would have all the dataset_ids classified as Primary.

Monitoring eggs and larval fish may be more informative than that traditional fish surveys since ichthyoplankton surveys reveal the reproductive activities of fish populations, which directly impact their population trajectories. Ichthyoplankton surveys have turned to molecular methods (DNA barcoding & metabarcoding) for identification of eggs and larval fish due to challenges of morphological identification. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of using metabarcoding methods on mock communities of known fish egg DNA. We constructed six mock communities with known ratios of species. In addition, we analyzed two samples from a large field collection of fish eggs and compared metabarcoding results with traditional DNA barcoding results. We examine the ability of our metabarcoding methods to detect species and relative proportion of species identified in each mock community. We found that our metabarcoding methods were able to detect species at very low input proportions; however, levels of successful detection depended on the markers used in amplification, suggesting that the use of multiple markers is desirable. Variability in our quantitative results may result from amplification bias as well as interspecific variation in mitochondrial DNA copy number. Our results demonstrate that there remain significant challenges to using metabarcoding for estimating proportional species composition; however, the results provide important insights into understanding how to interpret metabarcoding data.

First, looking at the `data_availability` section, there's a DOI: 10.5061/dryad.zw3r22854. The DOI is a Digital Object Identifier, which is a type of dataset ID. According to the key definitions, DOIs are dataset IDs only if they are explicitly used as such. The citation context here mentions Dryad Digital Repository, which is a data repository.

The different locomotor modes are likely to be linked to anatomical specializations of the skeleton within the typical frog Bauplan. While such anatomical adaptations of the hind limbs and the pelvic girdle are comparably well understood, the pectoral girdle received much less attention in the past. We tested for locomotor-mode-related shape differences in the pectoral girdle bones of 64 anuran species by means of micro-computed-tomography-based geometric morphometrics. The pectoral girdles of selected species were analyzed with regard to the effects of shape differences on muscle moment arms across the shoulder joint and stress dissipation within the coracoid. Phylogenetic relationships, size, and locomotor behavior have an effect on the shape of the pectoral girdle in anurans, but there are differences in the relative impact of these factors between the bones of this skeletal unit. Remarkable shape diversity has been observed within locomotor groups indicating many-to-one mapping of form onto function. Significant shape differences have mainly been related to the overall pectoral girdle geometry and the shape of the coracoid. Most prominent shape differences have been found between burrowing and nonburrowing species with headfirst and backward burrowing species significantly differing from one another and from the other locomotor groups. The pectoral girdle shapes of burrowing species have generally larger moment arms for (simulated) humerus retractor muscles across the shoulder joint, which might be an adaptation to the burrowing behavior.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON structure with a paper section, and I need to extract dataset IDs and classify them as Primary or Secondary. Let me start by reading through the input.

First, the title is about the pectoral girdle in anurans. The author is Karolin Engelkes. The abstract mentions using micro-computed tomography (CT) morphometrics to analyze shape differences in the pectoral girdle bones. The data availability section links to a website and provides a DOI in Appendix S1. The other dataset citations have a dataset ID and a citation context.

Now, I need to check if any dataset IDs are present. The data_availability has a DOI in Appendix S1. The other_dataset_citations list has a dataset_id with a DOI. Let me verify the DOI format. The DOI is 10.1007/s00435-017-0386-3. The format starts with 10., which matches the required format. The citation context mentions the authors, so it's a valid dataset. 

Next, I need to classify these as Primary or Secondary. For the DOI, the classification depends on the context. The abstract mentions the study's purpose, which is related to the pectoral girdle's shape and biomechanics. The citation context includes the authors, which is a direct reference to the authors of the paper. Since the first person listed is the author, this indicates that the dataset was generated by the authors of this paper. Therefore, it's Primary.

The other dataset citation also has a DOI. The same logic applies here. The authors are the ones who created the dataset, so it's Primary. 

I need to make sure there are no other dataset IDs. The data_availability section mentions the DOI, and the other citations also have a dataset_id. Both are valid and correctly formatted. 

Now, I should structure the output. Since both dataset IDs are valid, I need to return them as Primary. The JSON structure should have each dataset_id with the type. Let me double-check the classification logic to ensure I'm not making a mistake. The key points are that the authors are the ones generating the data, and the citation context confirms that.

The proliferation of camera trapping has enabled the collection of large datasets on wildlife, but researchers face hurdles inferring interactions from observational data. Recent advances in hierarchical co-abundance models infer species interactions while accounting for two species' detection probabilities, shared responses to environmental covariates, and propagate uncertainty throughout the entire modeling process. However, current approaches remain unsuitable for interacting species whose natural densities differ by an order of magnitude and have contrasting detection probabilities, such as predator-prey interactions, which introduce zero inflation and overdispersion in count histories. Here, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical N-mixture co-abundance model that is suitable for inferring predator-prey interactions. We accounted for excessive zeros in count histories using an informed zero-inflated Poisson distribution in the abundance formula and accounted for overdispersion in count histories by including a random effect per sampling unit and sampling occasion in the detection probability formula. We demonstrate that models with these modifications outperform alternative approaches, improve model goodness-of-fit, and overcome parameter convergence failures. We highlight its utility using 20 camera trapping datasets from 10 tropical forest landscapes in Southeast Asia and estimate four predator-prey relationships between tigers, clouded leopards, and muntjac and sambar deer. Tigers had a negative effect on muntjac abundance, providing support for top-down regulation, while clouded leopards had a positive effect on muntjac and sambar deer, likely driven by shared responses to unmodelled covariates like hunting.

The key indicators for Primary are original generation, and the DOI is for a new dataset. The other_dataset_citations is empty, so no secondary citations. 

The fallback rule says if ambiguous, default to Primary. Since the DOI is clearly a dataset, and the data_availability is valid, the classification should be Primary. 

So, the final JSON should include the dataset_id from the DOI and type Primary.

Lalonde,1"",""abstract"":""Abstract. Understanding the impact of herbivory on plant populations is a fundamental goal of ecology. Damage to individual plants can be visually striking and affect the fates of individuals, but these impacts do not necessarily translate into population-\u00adlevel differences in vital rates (survival, growth, or fecundity) or population growth rates. In biological control of weeds, quantitative assessments of population-\u00adlevel impacts of released agents on both target invasive plants and native, nontarget plants are needed to inform evaluations of the benefits and risks of releasing agents into new regions. Here we present a 3-\u00adyr exper-imental demographic field study using the European root-\u00adfeeding biocontrol weevil, Mogulones crucifer, first released in Canada in 1997 to control the invasive weed Cynoglossum officinale (Boraginaceae). Mogu-lones crucifer is an effective 'search and destroy' agent in Canada, but sporadically feeds, oviposits, and develops on native nontarget Boraginaceae. We investigated the population-\u00adlevel impacts of this biocon-trol insect on its target weed and a native nontarget plant, Hackelia micrantha (Boraginaceae), by releasing large numbers of weevils into naturally occurring patches of H. micrantha growing isolated from or inter-spersed with C. officinale. We followed the fates of individual plants on release and nonrelease (control) sites for two transition years, developed matrix models to project population growth rates (\u03bb) for each plant species, and examined the contributions from differences in vital rates to changes in \u03bb using life table response experiments (LTRE). In contrast to studies of the insect-plant interaction in its native range, as a biocontrol agent, M. crucifer increased mortality of C. officinale rosettes in the year immediately following release, depressing the weed's \u03bb to below the population replacement level. However, \u03bb for H. micrantha was never depressed below the replacement level, and any differences between release and nonrelease sites in the nontarget could not be explained by significant contributions from vital rates in the LTRE. This study is the first to simultaneously and experimentally examine target and nontarget population-\u00adlevel im-pacts of a weed biocontrol insect in the field, and supports the theoretical prediction that plant life history characteristics and uneven herbivore host preferences can interact to produce differences in population-\u00ad level impacts between target and nontarget plant species."",""data_availability"":""Data associated with this paper have been deposited in Dryad: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.p3fg9"",""other_dataset_citations"":[{""dataset_ids"":[""10.1002/ecs2.1280""],""citation_context"":""21508925, 2016, 5, Downloaded from https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.1280 by California Digital Library University Of California, Wiley Online Library on [31/03/2025].

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON string representing a paper section and wants me to extract dataset IDs and classify them as Primary or Secondary. 

First, I need to check the data_availability section. The data_availability here is ""Data associated with this paper have been deposited in Dryad: http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.p3fg9"". Dryad is a repository for datasets, so this is a valid dataset. The DOI here is 10.5061/dryad.p3fg9. But wait, the important DOI validation rule says only extract DOIs that are explicitly used as dataset IDs. Since this is a Dryad DOI, it's a dataset ID. So that's a valid dataset.

Next, the other_dataset_citations section has a citation with dataset_ids [""10.1002/ecs2.1280""] and a citation context. The DOI here is 10.1002/ecs2.1280. Again, this is a valid dataset ID. So both of these are valid dataset IDs.

Now, I need to classify them. For the first dataset, the citation context mentions ""21508925, 2016, 5, Downloaded from..."" which seems to be a citation, not a dataset. So the dataset_id is 10.5061/dryad.p3fg9. The citation context here is about a journal article, not a dataset. So this is a valid dataset ID but not a citation for the dataset. 

The second dataset has the DOI 10.1002/ecs2.1280. The citation context is about a journal article, so again, not a dataset. So both are valid dataset IDs but not citations for the dataset. 

Now, looking at the abstract, there's a mention of ""data release"" and ""dataset availability"". The data_availability section is about the dataset being deposited in Dryad, which is a data repository. The other_dataset_citations have their own citations, but the dataset IDs themselves are valid. 

So, both dataset IDs are valid. Now, according to the classification logic, I need to check if they are Primary or Secondary. The abstract mentions that the data is for a field study, which is a primary study. The data_availability is about the dataset being deposited, which is a primary data release. The other_dataset_citations are citations for the dataset, not the dataset itself. 

Therefore, both dataset IDs are Primary. The output should be two entries in the JSON array, each with the dataset_id and type ""Primary"".

These interactions between stressors, whether additive or antagonistic, may have profound effects on our assumptions about and predictions for any given system. Here we address this gap by exploring the interactive effects of introduced predators and elevated temperatures on emerging aquatic insects across alpine lakes. Using a crossed factorial field survey, we examine whether warmer temperatures either directly affect the magnitude or diversity of insect emergence, or mediate the impacts of predation via interactions with predator presence. Based on data from more than 11,000 insects collected across a two-year period, we find a 71% reduction in insect emergence associated with an additional 3.6 C of water temperature in oligotrophic alpine lakes. While our work confirms prior findings that predator presence drives strong reductions in insect emergence, we find that the effects of predation are significantly weaker in warmer lakes (2% reduction in warmest lakes studied vs. 75% reduction in coldest). Combining our results with regional studies of predator communities to identify mechanisms suggests that the interaction effects between temperature and predator presence are likely due to changes in predator behavior across temperatures. Critically, to fully understand the multiple stressors that impact insect populations and predict their future effects, we must consider the interactions between stressors across spatial scales."",""data_availability"":"""",""other_dataset_citations"":[{""dataset_ids"":[""10.25349/D9QW5X""],""citation_context"":""Data for: Interactions between Temperature and Predation Impact Insect Emergence in Alpine Lakes|Dryad.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON string representing a paper section, and I need to extract dataset IDs and classify them as Primary or Secondary. Let me start by reading through the input carefully.

First, the title is ""Interactions between temperature and predation impact insect emergence in alpine lakes"". The author is Caroline H Owens. The abstract mentions that the paper explores the interactive effects of predators and temperature on insect emergence. The data_availability is empty, so I need to check the other_dataset_citations.

Looking at the other_dataset_citations, there's a dataset with ID ""10.25349/D9QW5X"" and a citation context. The citation context says ""Data for: Interactions between Temperature and Predation Impact Insect Emergence in Alpine Lakes|Dryad. Dataset|10.25349/D9QW5X"". 

Now, I need to check if this dataset_id is a DOI or an Accession ID. The DOI format starts with ""10."" and has a suffix. The given ID is ""10.25349/D9QW5X"". The suffix here is ""D9QW5X"", which looks like an Accession ID. The key point is to apply the important DOI validation rule. The citation context mentions ""Dryad"" and ""Dataset"", which are common for datasets. 

Since the citation context clearly refers to a dataset, and the data_availability is empty, this seems like a valid dataset. Now, I need to check if this dataset is Primary or Secondary. The abstract mentions that the effects of predation are weaker in warmer lakes, which suggests that the data might be from an existing dataset. However, the citation context here is about the interaction between temperature and predation, which is the focus of the paper. 

The author is Caroline H Owens, and the dataset is part of the paper's findings. The citation context doesn't mention the author of the paper, so it's more likely Secondary. The data_availability is empty, so no other data sources are mentioned. 

Therefore, the dataset_id ""10.25349/D9QW5X"" is a Secondary dataset because it's from an existing source (Dryad) and the abstract indicates that the effects are due to interactions between temperature and predation, which is the focus of the paper. 

I should format the answer accordingly. Since there's one valid dataset, the output should be a JSON array with that dataset. No other dataset IDs are present, so the result is just that one entry.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON structure with some paper sections, and I need to extract dataset IDs. The task is to identify and classify them as Primary or Secondary based on the given rules.

First, looking at the input data: the `data_availability` section is empty, and the `other_dataset_citations` is also empty. According to the instructions, if both are empty, I should skip all tasks and output a ""Missing"" JSON structure. But in this case, both are empty, so I need to check if there are any dataset IDs. However, the data_availability is empty, so there's no data available. The other_dataset_citations is also empty. So according to Task 1, no valid dataset IDs are found. Therefore, I should return the ""Missing"" structure.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding. The user's input has the `data_availability` as an empty string, and `other_dataset_citations` as an empty list. So according to Task 1, no valid dataset IDs are found. Therefore, the correct output is the ""Missing"" JSON array. I need to make sure that I follow the instructions exactly. The user's example input has both sections empty, so the output should be the ""Missing"" structure. Yes, that's right. So the final answer is the JSON array with the missing dataset_id and type.

Email: rubikraf@gmail.com Funding information Nitobe School Project Abstract Field observations on small rivers of the Amazon basin are less common due to their remote location and difficult accessibility. Here we show, through remote sensing analysis and field works, the planform evolution and riverbed topography of a small river located in the upper foreland Amazon basin, the Ichilo River. By tracking plan-form changes over 30 years, we identified the factors that control meander migration rates in the Ichilo River: cutoffs, climate and human interventions. The data suggest that neck cutoffs are the main controls in the Ichilo River, with an annual density of 0.022 cutoffs/km. In addition, climate controls have been identified in the form of high-precipitation events that may have promoted cutoffs, an increase in meander migration rate and channel widening. The width distribution of the Ichilo River is well represented by general extreme value and inverse Gaussian distributions. The spatio-temporal variability of meandering migration rates in the Ichilo River is analysed in two locations where neck cutoffs are expected. Analysing the distance across the neck in these two points, we predict the occurrence of a new cutoff. The combined methodology of bathymetric surveys and structure from motion photogrammetry shows us the Ichilo riverbed topography and banks at high resolution, where two scour holes were identified. Finally, we discuss the impact of planform changes of the Ichilo River on communities that are established along its riverbanks.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON string representing a paper section with title, author, abstract, data_availability, and other_dataset_citations. My job is to extract valid dataset IDs and classify them as Primary or Secondary.

First, I need to check the data_availability section. The abstract mentions ""data availability"" and ""dataset"" in the citation contexts. The data_availability is a string, so I should look for any DOI or Accession IDs here. The example in the data_availability has ""10.1002/esp.5058"" and ""10.5066/P9FW6E8K"". These look like DOIs. I need to apply the important DOI validation rule: only extract DOIs that are explicitly used as dataset IDs. The citation contexts here are ""10969837, 2021, 4, Downloaded from..."" and ""Dataset Kinzel, P., Nelson, J.M. & Kattia, R.A.F. (2019) Bathymetric survey..."". Both of these seem to be DOIs. So, I'll extract those.

Next, check the other_dataset_citations. Each entry has a dataset_id and a citation context. The first entry has ""10.1002/esp.5058"" and the citation context mentions ""10969837, 2021, 4, Downloaded from..."" which matches the DOI. The second entry has ""10.1002/esp.4637"" and the citation context is a list of authors. The third entry has ""10.5066/P9FW6E8K"" and the citation context is a single line. The fourth entry has ""10.1029/2005JF000416"" and the citation context is another line. All these are DOIs, so they should be extracted.

Now, I need to classify each dataset_id as Primary or Secondary. For each DOI, I check the abstract and citation contexts. The abstract mentions ""data availability"" and ""dataset"" in the citations. The first citation context refers to a study by Kinzel et al. and the data is from the U.S. Geological Survey. The second citation context is a list of authors, but the first author is the author of the paper, so it's Primary. The third and fourth entries also refer to the same dataset, so they are Primary. 

Wait, the third entry's citation context is a single line with ""Dataset Kinzel..."" and the data is from the U.S. Geological Survey. The fourth entry's citation context is a list of authors, but the first is the author of the paper, so it's Primary. 

So all the dataset IDs are Primary. The other_dataset_citations also have the same dataset, so they are Primary. 

Now, the data_availability section is empty, so I skip Task 1. Then, Task 2 and 3 proceed. The final output should be a JSON array with the dataset IDs classified as Primary. Since all are Primary, the result is a list of those dataset_ids.

No paleo-scarps or potentially analogous topographic features are evident in pre-earthquake Worldview-1 and Worldview-2 satellite data. Two excavations across the surface rupture expose near-surface fault geometry and mixed aeolian-sheetwash sediment faulted only in the 2016 earthquake. A 10.6 \u00b1 0.4 ka optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) age of sheetwash sediment provides a minimum estimate for the period of quiescence prior to 2016 rupture. Seven cosmogenic beryllium-10 ( 10 Be) bedrock erosion rates are derived for samples < 5 km distance from the surface rupture on the hanging-wall and foot-wall, and three from samples 19 to 50 km from the surface rupture. No distinction is found between fault proximal rates (1.3 \u00b1 0.1 to 2.6 \u00b1 0.2 m Myr \u22121 ) and distal samples (1.4 \u00b1 0.1 to 2.3 \u00b1 0.2 m Myr \u22121 ). The thickness of rock fragments (2-5 cm) coseismically displaced in the Petermann earthquake perturbs the steady-state bedrock erosion rate by only 1 to 3%, less than the erosion rate uncertainty estimated for each sample (7-12%). Using 10 Be erosion rates and scarp height measurements we estimate approximately 0.5 to 1 Myr of differential erosion is required to return to pre-earthquake topography. By inference any pre-2016 fault-related topography likely required a similar time for removal. We conclude that the Petermann earthquake was the first on this fault in the last ca. 0.5-1 Myr. Extrapolating single nuclide erosion rates across this timescale introduces large uncertainties, and we cannot resolve whether 2016 represents the first ever surface rupture on this fault, or a > 1 Myr interseismic period. Either option reinforces the importance of including distributed earthquake sources in fault displacement and seismic hazard analyses."",""data_availability"":"""",""other_dataset_citations"":[{""dataset_ids"":[""10.1080/08120090802546977""],""citation_context"":""Constraints on the current rate of deformation and surface uplift of the Australian continent from a new seismic database and low-T thermochronological data|Australian Journal of Earth Sciences|https://doi.org/10.1080/08120090802546977""},{""dataset_ids"":[""10.1177/0959683613515732""],""citation_context"":""Late-Holocene climatic variability indicated by three natural archives in arid southern Australia|Holocene|https://doi.org/10.1177/0959683613515732""}]}

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON structure with sections for a paper, and I need to extract dataset IDs and classify them as Primary or Secondary. Let me start by looking at the input.

First, the title is empty, so I don't have that. The author is also empty, which might be a problem, but maybe it's just an empty string. The abstract mentions a 20 May 2016 earthquake in Australia, which is a geological event. The data_availability section is empty, and the other_dataset_citations have two entries. 

Looking at the other_dataset_citations, each has a dataset_id. The first one is ""10.1080/08120090802546977"" and the citation context says it's from a new seismic database and low-T thermochronological data. The second is ""10.1177/0959683613515732"" with a citation about climatic variability in arid southern Australia.

Now, I need to check if these dataset IDs are valid. The first one looks like a DOI. The important rule says only extract DOIs that are explicitly used as dataset IDs. The citation context mentions a new database, so it's a dataset. The second one is a DOI as well, and the citation context refers to a climatic study, which is a dataset. 

Next, I need to classify them as Primary or Secondary. The abstract mentions the earthquake and the data used. The data_availability is empty, so I can't check that. The other_dataset_citations have both entries. 

For the first dataset_id, the citation context refers to a new seismic database and low-T data. Since the authors of the paper are not mentioned in the citation context, but the first person in the citation is ""Aerts H, Wee L, Velazquez E*, et al."" which might be people, not the authors. However, the abstract doesn't mention the authors, so maybe the dataset is from an external source. But the key is to check if the data was generated by the authors of this paper. The abstract doesn't state that, so maybe it's Secondary. 

The second dataset_id's citation context is about climatic variability, which is a dataset. The authors of the paper are not mentioned, so again, maybe Secondary. 

But wait, the classification logic says if the citation context refers to people, check if the first person is the author. If not, it's Secondary. The first citation's citation context includes ""Aerts H, Wee L, Velazquez E*, et al."" which might be people, but the author is not specified. The second citation's citation context is about a study, so maybe the dataset is from an external source. 

So both dataset IDs are from external sources. Therefore, they should be classified as Secondary. 

But wait, the first dataset_id's citation context mentions a new database, which could imply that the data was generated by the authors of the paper. However, the abstract doesn't mention the authors, so maybe it's Secondary. 

I think both dataset IDs are Secondary because they refer to external datasets. The first one is from a new database, and the second from a climatic study. The classification logic says if the citation context refers to people, check if the first person is the author. Since the first person in both citations is not the author, it's Secondary. 

Therefore, both dataset IDs are Secondary. The output should be two entries in the JSON array with type ""Secondary"".

The segmentation of these anatomic regions precedes fundamental tasks in image analysis pipelines such as lung structure segmentation, lesion detection, and radiomics feature extraction. Bilateral thoracic cavity volumes and pleural effusion volumes were manually segmented on CT scans acquired from The Cancer Imaging Archive 'NSCLC Radiomics' data collection. Four hundred and two thoracic segmentations were first generated automatically by a U-Net based algorithm trained on chest CTs without cancer, manually corrected by a medical student to include the complete thoracic cavity (normal, pathologic, and atelectatic lung parenchyma, lung hilum, pleural effusion, fibrosis, nodules, tumor, and other anatomic anomalies), and revised by a radiation oncologist or a radiologist. Seventy-eight pleural effusions were manually segmented by a medical student and revised by a radiologist or radiation oncologist. Interobserver agreement between the radiation oncologist and radiologist corrections was acceptable. All expert-vetted segmentations are publicly available in NIfTI format through The Cancer Imaging Archive at https://doi.org/10.7937/tcia.2020.6c7y-gq39 . Tabular data detailing clinical and technical metadata linked to segmentation cases are also available. Thoracic cavity segmentations will be valuable for developing image analysis pipelines on pathologic lungs - where current automated algorithms struggle most. In conjunction with gross tumor volume segmentations already available from 'NSCLC Radiomics,' pleural effusion segmentations may be valuable for investigating radiomics profile differences between effusion and primary tumor or training algorithms to discriminate between them."",""data_availability"":"""",""other_dataset_citations"":[{""dataset_ids"":[""10.7937/K9/TCIA.2015.PF0M9REI""],""citation_context"":""Aerts HJWL , Wee L , Rios Velazquez E , et al.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON structure with a paper section and wants me to extract dataset IDs and classify them as Primary or Secondary. 

First, I need to check the data_availability section. The input says it's empty, so I should look at the other_dataset_citations. There are two entries. 

Looking at the first citation: dataset_ids are [""10.7937/K9/TCIA.2015.PF0M9REI""] and the citation context mentions Aerts HJWL, Wee L, Rios Velazquez E, et al. The first person here is the author of the paper, Kiser Kendall J. So this seems like a Primary dataset. The DOI is valid and refers to a dataset, so that's a Primary.

The second citation has a dataset_id of [""10.7937/tcia.2020.6c7y-gq39""] and the context is Kiser KJ, Ahmed S, Stieb SM, et al. Again, the first person is the author, so this is also Primary. 

Wait, but the data_availability is empty, so I need to check the other sections. Both citations are valid and refer to datasets. So both should be Primary. 

I need to make sure there are no other dataset IDs. The other_dataset_citations have those two. So the output should have both dataset IDs classified as Primary. 

No missing dataset IDs here. So the final JSON array should include both entries.

Its population declined in the 1950s and never fully recovered. Canada has listed Silver Chub in the Great Lakes-\u00adSt. Lawrence River as endangered and has initiated a recovery plan that recognized the identification of spawning areas as a critical component to inform Silver Chub's recovery potential. Methods: We investigated potential spawning locations of Silver Chub using cap-ture records, otolith microchemistry, and daily age analysis. Lapillus otolith Sr:Ca ra-tios from 27 age-\u00ad0 Silver Chub were used to identify potential spawning areas. Daily ages estimated from lapilli were used to calculate hatch dates, which then were com-pared with capture data of adults and river flows to further inform potential spawn-ing areas. Result: The Detroit River (and its nearshore area) was all but ruled out as a potential spawning location. The Maumee, Portage, and Sandusky rivers or their nearshore areas were all possible spawning locations. Projected hatch dates spanned the end of May through the end of June and occurred across a wide range of flows, although some peaks in hatch dates corresponded to flow peaks, indicating recruitment is po-tentially enhanced by high flows. Conclusion: Silver Chub spawning period and hypothesized spawning rivers or lacustuaries overlap those of invasive Grass Carp Ctenopharyngodon idella, creat-ing a need to jointly consider Grass Carp control efforts with conservation of Silver Chub when assessing management alternatives. Further research on spawning guild and the use of rivers themselves or nearshore areas influenced by rivers as spawning areas are required to maximize potential for conservation and recovery of Silver Chub."",""data_availability"":""DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT U.S. Geological Survey data are publicly available at the websites in the references section.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON string with a paper's sections, and I need to extract dataset IDs and classify them as Primary or Secondary. Let me start by understanding the structure.

First, the input JSON has ""title"", ""author"", ""abstract"", ""data_availability"", and ""other_dataset_citations"". The data_availability has a string with DOI links, and other_dataset_citations have lists of dataset IDs. The task is to check each dataset_id in these sections to determine if it's Primary or Secondary.

Looking at the abstract, the main point is about Silver Chub's population decline and recovery. The data_availability mentions U.S. Geological Survey data, which includes various datasets. The other_dataset_citations have entries like ""10.5066/P9GTUMAY."" and ""10.5066/P94BH3W0."".

Now, I need to check each dataset_id. For each, I should look in the abstract and citation contexts. The key is to see if the dataset is directly related to the research topic. The abstract mentions Silver Chub's spawning areas, so looking at the citations, the first one is about a doctoral dissertation by Koel and Farver, which is a dataset. The citation context here is ""associated species. Doctoral dissertation. The Ohio State University..."" which points to a dataset. So that's a Primary dataset because it's a new data product created by the authors.

Next, the second citation is about Grass Carp eggs, which is a secondary dataset because it's related to another species. The third citation is about daily ages of Silver Chub, which is a Primary dataset since it's part of the research. The fourth citation is about a Fisheries Society publication, which is also a Primary dataset. The last one is about a USGS data release, which is a Secondary dataset because it's from a different source.

I need to ensure that each dataset_id is only processed once. Also, check if the data_availability is empty or the other_citations are empty. In this case, both are not, so proceed. Now, classify each dataset. The first one is Primary, the second Secondary, third Primary, fourth Secondary. So the final JSON array should include all these entries.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided a JSON structure with some paper sections, and I need to extract dataset IDs. First, I'll check the data_availability section. The data_availability here is ""Acknowledgments"", which doesn't look like a dataset. So, I'll move to the other_dataset_citations section. There are no entries there, so Task 1 didn't find any valid dataset IDs. Since Task 1 resulted in no valid IDs, I need to return the ""Missing"" JSON structure as per Scenario A. The dataset_id is missing, and the type is also missing. I should make sure to format it correctly as per the instructions.
